Defining your infrastructure as code provides you with the most benefit when you deploy *all* of your infrastructure from code and use pipelines to automate the deployment process.

In this module, you learned how to plan your environments so that you can strategically target your controls where they have the most impact. Then, because deployment pipelines and code are so important, you learned how to apply controls to your pipelines and repositories. Finally, you learned how to configure your Azure environment to ensure that all changes are deployed by using your approved process, while still allowing for emergency access.

The purpose of this module is to increase your confidence in, and the security of, your Azure deployments. This module has helped you ensure that changes follow a consistent process, are audited and logged, and that only authorized users can perform them.
