Contoso Industries has a rich environment that supports multiple departments, with many internal and external applications. Contoso uses images to manage deployments, but has found issues with creating images that also include applications because they are typically on different lifecycle schedules. They also have some systems that require older OS images to run legacy software until it can be migrated to the most recent versions. 

Managing all of the images has become burdensome and there have been a few times when images had to be rolled-back. Change tracking is important.
