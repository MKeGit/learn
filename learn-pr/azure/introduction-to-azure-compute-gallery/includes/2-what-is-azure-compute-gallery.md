Azure Compute Gallery is a centralized repository for storing, managing, and sharing your custom virtual machine images and virtual machine applications.

Your custom images can be created from a virtual machine, virtual hard disk, snapshot, managed image, or another image version.

With a gallery, you can share your resources to everyone, or limit sharing to different users, service principals, or AD groups within your organization. Resources can be replicated to multiple regions, for quicker scaling of your deployments.

The main goal of Azure Compute Gallery is to help you build structure and organization around your Azure virtual machine resources.
