In the assess phase, you evaluate the readiness of your workload and plan for the migrated state. After you complete this phase, you can deploy the workload for migration.

Your cloud adoption team should evaluate technical compatibility, the required architecture, performance and sizing expectations, and dependencies. Use this information to ensure that you can deploy the migrated workload to the cloud effectively.

## Classify workloads for a migration

Classification helps clarify governance, security, operations, and cloud-scale analytics requirements. You can classify data based on how a potential leak of that data affects a business or customers. More sensitive data increases the security risk.

Workload criticality is based on how significantly an outage affects a business. Share your workload classifications with your supporting teams. Low or unsupported workloads are likely to have little influence on your supporting teams. However, as workloads approach mission-critical or unit-critical classifications, their operational dependencies become more visible.
