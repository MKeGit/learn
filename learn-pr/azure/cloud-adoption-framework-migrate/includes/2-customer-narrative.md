The *Getting Started module* describes Tailwind Traders' objectives. The Tailwind Traders cloud strategy team defined an executive-level strategy that addresses financial and technical considerations.

To manage the various projects that contribute to that strategic program, Tailwind Traders implemented a cloud adoption plan. The central operations and infrastructure team deployed an Azure landing zone that meets its short-term compliance and operations needs.

Most relevant to this module is the company's effort to migrate out of two leased datacenters before their leases expire. The datacenters host an extensive portfolio of production workloads that support in-store and e-commerce operations. One of the datacenters also hosts dev/test environments and other preproduction innovations from the retail innovation team.

This module continues the Tailwind story as the migration team prepares to migrate workloads into the cloud.

## The Tailwind Traders migration plan

The Plan module used Azure Migrate to rationalize the company's digital estate and used Azure DevOps to create a backlog to guide the migration. Now the migration team can migrate the existing datacenters to the cloud. The team chose the Cloud Adoption Framework migrate methodology for their migration.

The remaining units of this module demonstrate processes, tools, and approaches that your team can use to successfully migrate your workloads to the cloud.
