Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance offers a resilient solution for deploying the Microsoft SQL Server database engine in a wide range of hybrid scenarios.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a New York-based financial-services company with a global customer base and several US government contracts. Your on-premises environment contains several SQL Server databases hosted in overseas datacenters that are subject to data-residency requirements. It also includes the US government contract-related data that needs to be fully isolated from the internet.

As the IT infrastructure engineering team lead, you assist solution architects, data engineers, and software developers with modernizing internal and public-facing services and applications. Your recent efforts led to your company adopting Kubernetes as the internal standard for container orchestration. Following the directives from company’s technology leadership to minimize the administrative overhead, streamline the operational model, and increase the resiliency of business-critical workloads, you decided to migrate the on-premises databases to the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance platform.

The migration plan raised some resiliency concerns. The SQL Server databases hosted in overseas datacenters need to be highly available and must support an automatic failover within the same physical location in case of a localized failure. Access to the US government contract-related data is considered business-critical, and must allow for disaster recovery with a manual failover to another US-based datacenter in case of an incident affecting the local datacenter's availability.

Another important resiliency consideration relates to backups. The existing data stores are currently configured with automatic backup, which supports point-in-time restore. It's essential that the migrated databases offer the same capability.
