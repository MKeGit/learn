  questions:
  - content: 'Through which mechanism does Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provide high availability for the General Purpose service tier?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Kubernetes'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. With the General Purpose tier, high availability option is provided by Kubernetes.'
    - content: 'Contained availability groups'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Contained availability groups provide high availability for Business Critical tier deployments. The service tier impacts the amount of time it takes to perform a failover.'
    - content: 'Azure Container Instances'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Azure Container Instances are not used with Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance.'
  - content: 'Which option is valid for recovering an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance database prior to an issue being experienced, allowing for recovering maliciously damaged or corrupt data?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Performing a manual failover to a secondary replica in the primary site.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. A manual failover does not recover a database to a point in time prior to the identified issue.'
    - content: 'Performing a point-in-time restore of the database to a state prior to the identified incident.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Doing so will revert the state of the database to a point in time prior to the identified issue.'
    - content: 'Performing a manual failover to a secondary site.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. A manual failover will not recover the database to a point in time prior to the identified issue.'
  - content: 'Which command performs a failover to the secondary site when the Kubernetes cluster hosting the Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance in the primary site is lost?'
    choices:
    - content: 'az sql instance-failover-group-arc update --role secondary'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This command should be executed if the Kubernetes cluster in the primary site is available.'
    - content: 'az sql instance-failover-group-arc update --role force-primary-allow-data-loss'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. This command forces the chosen secondary to become the primary and implies the possibility of data loss.'
    - content: "az sql mi-arc update --preferred-primary-replica"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. This command is used to set the new primary replica in the primary site. This action does not allow for failover to a secondary site.'
  - content: 'Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance provides built-in automated database backups. Which type of database is not backed up as part of this built-in service?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Master database'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. Master database is automatically backed up.'
    - content: 'User database in Full Recovery Model'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Incorrect. User databases in Full Recovery model are automatically backed up.'
    - content: 'User database in Simple Recovery Model'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Correct. Databases in the Simple Recovery Model are not supported in the automated backup.'
