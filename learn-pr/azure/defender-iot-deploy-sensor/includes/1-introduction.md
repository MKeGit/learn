Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive threat detection for IoT/OT environments, with multiple deployment options that include cloud-connected, fully on-premises, or hybrid environments.

This module describes the steps required to deploy an Operational Technology (OT) sensor and connect it to Defender for IoT monitoring.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a car manufacturer that has offices and production sites across the globe. You're tasked with implementing a system to monitor traffic and secure your manufacturing automation systems (OT), from the access panels to the pneumatic and packaging systems. To take your organization's OT security visibility to a whole new level, your team chooses to use Microsoft Defender for IoT.

You’ve been tasked with installing Defender for IoT monitoring software on your new OT sensors. You have the activation file from the onboarded OT sensor, and the list of your sensor’s required endpoints. You must check that your deployment department created a virtual machine (VM) to run the sensor on and then install the monitoring software on to the sensor. Then, use your activation file to complete your deployment and connect your sensor to Azure.

## What will we be doing?

In this module you'll complete the following tasks:

- **Check the virtual machine**: Ensure that the VM is configured correctly and runs the OT sensor.
- **Download the monitoring software**: Download the ISO file from the Azure portal.
- **Install monitoring software**: Install the ISO file on the sensor.
- **Set up the sensor**: Define the sensor's network and interface settings.
- **Activate the sensor**: Run the activation file and assign security signatures.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be familiar with the process of deploying and activating your OT sensor so it can start sending data to Microsoft Defender for IoT.
