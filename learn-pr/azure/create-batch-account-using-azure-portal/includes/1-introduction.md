Imagine that you're a software developer for a multimedia company with hundreds of thousands of videos. Video quality has a direct impact on customer retention, so you want to transcode content for optimal resolution and delivery across different platforms.

Transcoding is compute-intensive, and you want to set up a system that can process an existing library of content and new content on an as-needed basis. You decide to invest in an Azure Batch workload to get the job done. With Batch, you can perform large-scale compute-intensive operations with minimal administration.

Best of all, with Azure you pay for only what you use!
