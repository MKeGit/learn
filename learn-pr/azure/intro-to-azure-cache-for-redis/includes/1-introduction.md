Databases form the cornerstone of many enterprise apps. Making your databases as responsive as possible is vital for modern app development. Azure Cache for Redis can help you improve your apps' performance and scalability by copying frequently accessed data and storing it in memory.

As the following graphic illustrates, Azure Cache for Redis can help improve performance in apps that interface with many database solutions, including Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Database for MySQL.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a company that makes athletic shoes. You sell these shoes on your website and you're analyzing website visits. You realize there's a reduction in the percentage of visits that translate into sales. Closer inspection of data indicates that performance issues are causing potential customers to leave your website before making a purchase.

Management wants you to resolve this issue and return your website sales to previous levels. You can use Azure Cache for Redis to solve this problem. It caches frequently accessed data in memory, so the website doesn't have to repeatedly retrieve the same information. This caching results in improved website performance and sales.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you evaluate how Azure Cache for Redis can improve the performance and scalability of your apps. You also learn how Azure Cache for Redis provides a critical low-latency and high-throughput data-storage solution to modern apps. With this information, you're able to evaluate how Azure Cache for Redis helps improve the performance and scalability of apps that rely heavily on back-end data stores.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you're able to evaluate whether Azure Cache for Redis is the appropriate caching solution for your apps.
