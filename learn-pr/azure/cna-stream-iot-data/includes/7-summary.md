You've now successfully completed the evaluation of Azure IoT Central. As a result, you're confident that Adatum's development team can extend the scope of its native-cloud applications to incorporate IoT telemetry.

In this module, you learned about using Azure IoT Central to design and implement IoT telemetry data pipelines. You implemented a custom Azure IoT Central application and defined the IoT device capabilities. You also configured telemetry-driven rules for triggering alerts and remediating actions. Finally, you exported telemetry data to an internet-accessible data store.

Now that you've completed this module, you should know more about how to:

* Describe the role of Azure IoT Central.
* Design and implement Azure IoT Central-based telemetry processing.
