  questions:
  - content: Which of the following answers best describes the operating model at Tailwind Traders?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Because a centralized team supports all production operations, Tailwind Traders can't support this operating model.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Enterprise operations aren't currently a good fit for Tailwind Traders.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Operations at Tailwind Traders aren't complex enough to fit this operating model.
  - content: In the customer narrative, there's a controlled process for release of the solutions that come from the retail innovation team. If that process improves to allow that team to manage its own workloads in a controlled landing zone, which operating model would best describe the new arrangement?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The central operations team isn't going away, so the decentralized model still wouldn't fit.
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When additional teams are allowed to manage production operations, the centralized model becomes unruly.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This change wouldn't suggest a distributed operations approach. Try again.
  - content: The retail innovation team was entirely workload focused before Tailwind Traders acquired it. Based on what you know, what operating model best describes how that team operated before the acquisition?
    choices:
    - content: Decentralized operations
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct!
    - content: Centralized operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: There were no centralized support services before the acquisition. Try again.
    - content: Enterprise operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Enterprise operations would require centralized operations and innovative workload teams. There were no centralized support services before the acquisition.
    - content: Distributed operations
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Although the company might become distributed after a few more acquisitions, Tailwind Traders isn't there today, nor was the startup before the acquisition.
  # - content: Which of the following is an indicator that centralized operations are the best fit for Tailwind Traders?
  #   choices:
  #   - content: Openness to embrace cloud-native operations tools and processes
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The narrative suggests limited appetite for cloud-native tools and processes. This customer currently needs a best-of-breed approach.
  #   - content: Multiple teams accessing production environments
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: Only the central operations team has access to production. There is currently no need for a more complex approach to separation of duties.
  #   - content: Size of the central operations team
  #     isCorrect: true
  #     explanation: An enterprise operations approach could provide advantages, but the strained staff and lack of well-organized teams outside central operations would add strain to the current team structure. Organizational change would be required to adopt enterprise operations.
  #   - content: Scope of the portfolio
  #     isCorrect: false
  #     explanation: The overall scope of the portfolio is large enough to qualify for enterprise operations. This is an indicator that an enterprise operations approach might be beneficial.
