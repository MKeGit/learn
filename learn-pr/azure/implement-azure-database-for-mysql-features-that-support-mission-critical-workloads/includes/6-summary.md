You have decided on the features you want to include use on Wingtip Toys' MySQL flexible server and you know how to configure them. In summary, you have:
- Configured Microsoft Entra for centralized user management.

- Encrypted data at rest with a customer-managed key.

- Enabled the database with zone redundant high availability.

- Configured geo-redundant database backups.

- Deployed Business Critical compute SKUs.

- Enabled the Autoscale IOPS feature.

- Provisioned a read replica for reporting queries and data analytics.

You're now ready to migrate the Wingtip Toys' data from the on-premises MySQL server to your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.
