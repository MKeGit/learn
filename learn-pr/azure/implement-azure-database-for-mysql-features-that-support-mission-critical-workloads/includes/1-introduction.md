Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed MySQL database as a service (DBaaS) offering on Azure that can handle mission-critical workloads with resiliency, predictable performance, and dynamic scalability.

In this module, you'll take a hands-on tour configuring networking, security, business continuity, server maintenance, and performance tuning. You should have a previous evaluation of your business needs to choose which options to configure. For this module, the example scenario below spells out the business needs.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at an e-commerce startup, Wingtip Toys (WT). You've been using an on-premises infrastructure and want to use Azure cloud services. WT has grown and is launching a major marketing campaign next quarter. You expect site traffic and purchases to go up significantly. Naturally, database uptime is crucial to the e-commerce site and to accommodate incoming customer orders.

WT's technology department has grown and now, in addition to the product development team, includes a data science team. The data science team runs large reporting and analytics queries. In the past, experiments with reporting have caused database performance problems, and you want to make sure the data science team can do their job without affecting the main site.

In addition, as WT hires more employees, their DBA team has struggled to keep up with managing users and permissions. With the migration to Azure, you want to centralize user management, authentication, and authorization.â€¯ Finally, because the database holds sensitive information like birthdays and personal shipping addresses, you want to make sure all data is encrypted at rest.

## What you will do

You'll understand and implement the Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server's features, including networking, security, business continuity, high availability, backups, performance, IOPS, and read replicas, that support mission-critical operations.

## Primary goal

By the end of this module, you'll have chosen settings during flexible server creation and learned how to change them afterwards. In addition, you'll have reviewed how to monitor the flexible server's operations and make and restore backups.
