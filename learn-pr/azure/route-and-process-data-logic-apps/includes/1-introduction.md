In this module, you create a business workflow in Azure Logic Apps to automate the processing of tweets for basketball shoes produced by an athletic shoe company. Your workflow will trigger and run when a new tweet is available. The workflow uses cloud services to determine if the content is positive or negative and takes different steps based on the results. After processing completes, the workflow saves the data in a cloud-hosted database. When you finish this module, you'll have learned how to create workflows that route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and its connectors.
