Many businesses today work with data across diverse services, systems, and apps. If your business is similar, as a developer you often face challenges around integrating products and technologies so that they can work together. Success depends on integration solutions that run efficiently, smoothly, and seamlessly to route the necessary data to the appropriate task. By automating the workloads and data that power your business processes, you can streamline your business even further.

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud platform that helps you implement business processes as automated Azure cloud-hosted workflows and integrate data across your enterprise or organizations. This platform simplifies how you design and build scalable integration solutions that work with the cloud, on premises, or both. You can build integration solutions for a wide range of scenarios, not only inside your company and customer-facing, but also business to business (B2B). The platform provides a visual designer that makes creating workflows easier whether you use the browser, Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio. With access to 1,000+ prebuilt connectors and operations that work with a vast variety of services, systems, apps, and data, you rarely have to write any code. If no prebuilt connectors are available for APIs that you want to call, you can create your own custom connectors to call those APIs. Either way, you save time because you write little to no code.

In this module, you create a logic app workflow that implements a business process using Azure Logic Apps. This workflow automates the processing of news articles about the athletic shoe market for an athletic shoe company that wants to stay informed. When a new article is available, your workflow launches and starts to run. The workflow uses cloud services to determine whether the article is ranked as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed sentiment, and takes different steps based on the results. After processing completes, the workflow saves the positive articles as blobs in an Azure storage container or sends all other articles to the public relations team.

When you finish this module, you'll have learned how to create workflows that route and process data using Azure Logic Apps and other cloud services.
