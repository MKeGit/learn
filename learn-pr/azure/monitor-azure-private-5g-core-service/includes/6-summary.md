To ensure the availability and the performance of a private mobile network, Azure Private 5G Core allows you to monitor the private mobile network either centrally from Azure or locally at each site. 

From Azure, you can use platform metrics to do the monitoring. Additionally, Azure Private 5G Core supports monitoring the network with an application of your choice. These applications can use the Azure Monitor REST API to retrieve the health and performance metrics data from Azure Private 5G Core. You can also export the metrics data to another application like Azure Event Hubs or a storage account.

Locally at each site, you can use the packet core dashboards to do real-time monitoring.

To diagnose network issues for a site in your network, you can use the distributed tracing tool.

Now that you learned the tools for monitoring a private mobile network and the tool for troubleshooting network issues. You should be able to select an appropriate monitoring or troubleshooting tool based on the business requirements of an enterprise. After determining the tool, you need to design the monitoring and troubleshooting strategies for the enterprise.
