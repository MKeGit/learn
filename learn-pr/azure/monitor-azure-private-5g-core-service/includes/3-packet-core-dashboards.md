If you need to monitor a specific site in a private mobile network locally, you can use the packet core dashboards that Azure Private 5G Core provides. The packet core dashboards are powered by [*Grafana*](https://grafana.com/grafana/), an open-source, metric analytics and visualization suite.

The packet core dashboards are available from the Azure Stack Edge (ASE) server on which the packet core instance is deployed. As they run locally on the ASE server, the impact of the network bandwidth and the cloud connectivity is minimized. With the packet core dashboards, you can monitor each site in your private mobile network continuously and in real time.

## Dashboard user interface and default dashboards

Each dashboard contains the following user interface components:

- Panels: Panels are for displaying statistics. Each statistic is displayed on a panel.

  The packet core dashboards provide *graph* panels and *single stat* panels. The *graph* panels display multiple statistics and/or recent changes in a statistic. The *single stat* panels display a single statistic.

- Rows: Rows are for organizing panels. Each dashboard has a minimum of one row.

The following example dashboard contains both *graph* and *single stat* panels that are arranged into four rows:

By default, Azure Private 5G Core provides the following packet core dashboards:

- The **Overview** dashboard: Displays important key performance indicators (KPIs), including the number of connected devices, throughput, and any alerts firing in the system.
- The **Alert** dashboard: Provides information on the severity and effect of each firing alert.
- The **Device and Session Statistics** dashboard: Provides information about the device and session procedures being processed by the packet core instance.
- The **Uplink and Downlink Statistics** dashboard: Provides detailed statistics on the user plane traffic being handled by the packet core instance.
- The **Debug** dashboards: Show detailed breakdowns of the request and response statistics for the packet core instance's interfaces. The **Debug** dashboards include the **System Statistics** dashboard, the **HTTP stats** dashboard, and the **4G Interfaces** dashboard.

For more information about the packet core dashboards, see [Dashboards](/azure/private-5g-core/packet-core-dashboards). If you want to add new dashboards or customize existing dashboards based on your business needs, refer to the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/).

> [!NOTE]
> Some packet core dashboards display different panels depending on whether the packet core instance supports 5G or 4G UEs.

## Access the dashboards

The URL for accessing the packet core dashboards is as follows:

`https://<LocalMonitoringIP>/grafana`

Here *\<LocalMonitoringIP\>* is the IP address for accessing the local monitoring tools that you set up when you configure the management network during Azure Private 5G Core deployment.

Azure Private 5G Core provides two authentication methods for the packet core dashboards:

- Microsoft Entra ID: The [Microsoft Entra method](/azure/private-5g-core/enable-azure-active-directory) allows users to sign in with their Azure accounts.
- Username and password: The username/password method allows users to sign in with a default account.

Whenever possible, use the Microsoft Entra method, as it's more secure. Only use the username and password method when you don't have a stable connection to Azure. You can choose your preferred authentication method when you deploy or modify a site. For detailed instructions on configuring and using these authentication methods, see [Packet core dashboards](/azure/private-5g-core/packet-core-dashboards).

Access to the packet core dashboards is secured by HTTPS. You can use a self-signed certificate or provide your own to authenticate access to the dashboards. The article [Modify the local access configuration in a site](/azure/private-5g-core/modify-local-access-configuration) provides detailed instructions on checking or modifying the access certificate.

## Adjust the time range

To check specific data, you may need to adjust the time range of the data displayed on a dashboard. For example, to retrieve diagnostics for historical problems, you may need to change the time range to a period in the past.

You can use the **Time picker**, which is in the top right-hand corner of each packet core dashboard, to adjust the time range for which the dashboard will display statistics.

The following screenshot shows the time picker:
