You and your team at the community bank want to improve the lifecycle management of your Azure resources. Challenges arise as workloads grow in size.

In this module, you've learned about Azure deployment stacks and their benefits for resource management. Deployment stacks allow you to manage a group of Azure resources as a single unit, simplifying management and enabling consistent deployments. You can create, list, update, and delete deployment stacks using Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or the Azure portal. These stacks offer benefits such as simplified provisioning, prevention of unauthorized changes, easy resource cleanup, and support for standardized templates.

To better understand how deployment stacks work, you reviewed common ways to organize resources, the deployment stacks resource, and its resource provider.

Finally, you learned about common scenarios using deployment stacks and how those scenarios may apply to your internal processes.
