The goal in this module is to help you understand how Azure NetApp Files quotas work and how you can manage capacity consumption in Azure NetApp Files. You learned that: 

- The storage capacity of an Azure NetApp Files volume is limited to the set size (quota) of the volume.
- Various manual and automatic application-capacity management practices that can manage Azure NetApp Files (increased) capacity consumption.
- You can submit a support request for an increase of a regional capacity quota without incurring extra cost. Billing is still based on the provisioned capacity pools.

Here you also learned that you could restrict user capacity consumption on Azure NetApp Files volumes by setting user and/or group quotas on volumes, such as:

- Default user quota
- Individual user quota
- Combining default and individual user quota
- Default group quota
- Individual user quota
- Combining default and individual user and group quotas

Finally, you learnt the requirements and considerations that apply to using large volumes in Azure NetApp Files.
