Azure SQL Database is a service that you use to create a relational database in the cloud that's compatible with Microsoft SQL Server. SQL Database is highly scalable. It can support many thousands of concurrent requests. In SQL Database, you can define tables and then insert, update, delete, and query data.

Imagine that you work as a developer for a university. The university is creating a web application for academic advisors to use when discussing courses and plans of study with students. The development team wants to use SQL Database to store their data, which is currently in comma-delimited text files. They're planning to create a .NET Core app for advisors to use initially. They need to know how to create and manipulate a database and how to connect an ASP.NET application to query the database.

In this module, you create a single database by using the SQL Database service. You see how to import data into the database and query this data. Finally, you configure a web application to connect to and query the database.

SQL Database currently supports three deployment options: single, elastic pool, and managed instance. We focus on the single-database deployment option.
