  title: Transcribe large amounts of audio data with Batch Transcription
  description: Batch transcription is a feature of Azure AI Speech that lets you transcribe large amounts of pre-recorded audio data asynchronously. Batch transcription's high throughput makes it ideal for call centers that have to transcribe hundreds or thousands of calls every day to ensure they meet regulations and compliance standards. Batch transcription also enables better data analyses, which can let call centers ensure that customer feedback is taken into account, staff are treated fairly, and problems are dealt with quickly and properly.
