Our goal was to help you determine whether Azure Database for MySQL would be a good choice for your organization. The following criteria were developed to help you with your decision:

- Administrative effort
- Cost
- High-availability options

You applied these criteria to your organization, where your cloud architects and developers don't want to concern themselves with managing their apps' underlying OS and database. They want to focus on the development of their cloud-designed apps. Our analysis should have helped you decide that by using Azure Database for MySQL, a managed relational DBaaS offering, you can help your developers achieve this focus. Azure Database for MySQL can handle your mission-critical workloads with predictable performance and dynamic scalability.

The criteria should have helped you evaluate whether you can easily connect your existing client apps and database tools to your instance of Azure Database for MySQL. Allowing you to get the benefits of a PaaS environment. You've also analyzed the cost benefits and the use of high-availability options. You should now be able to assess whether Azure Database for MySQL can help you address your organization's database requirements.
