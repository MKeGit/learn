The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) is a cross-platform toolkit for building mixed reality experiences for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).

Suppose you're creating a mixed reality experience in which the user needs the ability to move, rotate, and scale a holographic object. Although you could start from scratch and create your own scripts to enable such manipulations, this can be time consuming and error-prone, especially if there are multiple objects to configure. The Toolkit provides a set of prebuilt components and features that you can use to accelerate your Windows Mixed Reality development. By the end of this module, you'll be able to set up a Unity project configured for Windows Mixed Reality development and add scripts to objects that enable users to move those objects with their hands.
