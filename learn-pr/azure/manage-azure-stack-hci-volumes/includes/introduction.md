Azure Stack HCI provides highly resilient and performant software-defined volumes.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a large financial-services company as a lead systems engineer. Your company develops highly specialized, proprietary commercial applications for its customers, and hosts those applications in its own datacenters.

As part of modernizing its technology, the company started deploying Azure Stack HCI across its on-premises locations. This deployment has significantly accelerated datacenter consolidation and enhanced the agility of compute workloads. It has also helped to minimize the dependency on expensive storage area networks (SANs) that are complex to manage.

As the company transitions from the SAN-based storage, it becomes necessary to ensure that the new infrastructure satisfies the performance and resiliency requirements of existing business-critical workloads. To make this transition as seamless as possible, you need to explore ways to maximize the benefits of the software-defined architecture offered by Azure Stack HCI.

You deployed an Azure Stack HCI unit into your proof-of-concept environment. Through research and testing, you identified the primary considerations regarding the choice and configuration of physical disks. Now you need to determine the optimal approach to divide these disks into logical volumes.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you explore the most important aspects of designing, implementing, and managing Azure Stack HCI storage volumes. You also review a couple of demonstrations illustrating the most common storage management tasks.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you can describe the primary characteristics of Azure Stack HCI storage volumes. You also have a better understanding of how to design, implement, and manage these volumes.
