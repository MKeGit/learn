Your role as a mixed reality engineer for a truck manufacturer is to create solutions that support manufacturing logistics. Your company is currently designing a new engine to replace their current production model, and has created a 3D virtual model of the new engine. This model enables the automotive engineering team to view and refine the engine design specifications.

However, viewing the model on a computer screen doesn't allow a full-scale detailed 3D view of the engine and its internal mechanics. Being able to use mixed reality and virtual reality devices like HoloLens 2 would help complete a design review of the engine.

In this module, you learn how to use Azure Remote Rendering to render a full-scale, detailed 3D model. You create a Remote Rendering account, load the 3D engine model in Unity, and connect your local Unity runtime to a Remote Rendering session. You can then view and interact with the model untethered at full scale and detail.

## Learning objectives

- Learn about Remote Rendering and managing sessions.
- Create a Remote Rendering account.
- Load a project and 3D model in Unity.
- Use Remote Rendering to render the 3D model.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 1903 or higher, or Windows 11. Windows 32-bit versions aren't supported.
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later, or Windows 11 SDK.
- Unity 2019.4.X or higher installed, with Unity Hub.
- Visual Studio 2019 or higher with the following workloads installed:
  - .NET desktop development
  - Desktop development with C++
  - Universal Windows Platform (UWP) development with C++ (v142) UWP tools
  - Game development with Unity
- Ideally, some familiarity with C# and Unity scripting and development.
