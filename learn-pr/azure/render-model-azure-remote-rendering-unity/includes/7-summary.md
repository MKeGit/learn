The automotive engineering team needed a solution for rendering a 3D model of a truck engine at full detail on an untethered device. You created an Azure Remote Rendering account and then configured a remote rendering object in Unity. After completing those steps, you were able to use Remote Rendering to load and render the truck engine model at full detail. You can build and deploy the Unity project to a HoloLens 2 device to view the model in your real-world environment.
