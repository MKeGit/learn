In this module, you explored the Azure command-line tools that allow you to
automate the provisioning of Azure resources at scale. You learned the basic concepts of
infrastructure as code and the key differences between the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Bicep, and
Terraform.

Knowing the capabilities and seeing the syntax for each Azure command-line tool can help you make an informed decision about which tools best meet your requirements.
