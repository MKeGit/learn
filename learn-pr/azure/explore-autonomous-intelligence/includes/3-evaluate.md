**Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** have reached human parity level, performing as good as humans on the task, for many applications, including object recognition, speech recognition, reading comprehension, machine translation, and general language processing. They've reached near human parity for speech synthesis. 

However, ML and DL algorithms suffer from the limitations of data. The results will only be as good as the quality of the input data and bias is going to be amplified. They're also black boxes that have no or reduced explainability. Therefore they aren't trusted, especially in industrial settings. They also have errors like false positives and false negatives that aren't human-like errors and are unexpected (every inference can be an error).

**Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithms have many *superpowers*. They can change behavior in response to changing conditions. They can learn complex and nonlinear relationships that require decisions to be made across fuzzy and nonlinear relationships between variables, transits of the environment state. They act on complex perception. They respond to environment changes that aren't directly measured. Finally and most importantly, they learn strategy.

However, DRLs also have limitations. They have no previous knowledge of the task at hand, which means they have to learn everything through a large number of trial-and-error iterations. This process is inefficient if they have to navigate a large state space. Fortunately, it's possible to reduce the complexity of DRLs by introducing domain knowledge to reduce the search space.  

In the following table, we summarize the strengths and limitations of the two main technologies included in Autonomous Intelligence: ML and DRL.
