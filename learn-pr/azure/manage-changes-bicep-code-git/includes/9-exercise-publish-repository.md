At the toy company, the website's developers have offered to help you write the Bicep template. You told them you've been keeping the Bicep code in a repository, and they've asked you to publish the repository. In this exercise, you'll publish your Git repository so that so your colleagues can view the files and collaborate with you.

During the process, you'll:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Create a new remote repository.
> - Configure your local Git repository to integrate with the remote repository.
> - Push your changes from your local repository to the remote repository.
> - Verify that the changes appear in the remote repository.

## Create a repository in GitHub

1. In a browser, go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com). Sign in with your GitHub account, or create a new account if you don't have one.

1. Select the plus (**+**) icon in the upper right of the window, and then select **New repository**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-github-new-repository-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface that shows the menu for creating a new repository." border="true":::

1. Enter the details of your new repository:

   - **Owner**: Select your GitHub user name from the drop-down menu. In the screenshot, `mygithubuser` is the repository owner's GitHub account name. You'll use your account name later in this module.
   - **Repository name**: Enter a meaningful but short name. For this module, use `toy-website-workflow`.
   - **Description**: Include a description to help others understand the repository's purpose.
   - **Private**: You can use GitHub to create public and private repositories. Create a private repository, because only people inside your organization should access your toy website's files. You can grant access to others later.

   After you're done, your repository configuration should look like the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-github-new-repository-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface that shows the configuration for the repository to create." border="true":::

1. Select **Create repository**.

1. On the confirmation page that appears, make a note of the repository's URL. You can use the copy button to copy the URL. You'll use it shortly.

## Create a repository in Azure Repos

1. In a browser, go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com). Sign in or create a new account.

1. If you're creating a new account, follow the prompts to create an Azure DevOps organization. Azure DevOps then asks you to create a new project. Continue to the next step.

   If you signed in to an existing Azure DevOps organization, select the **New project** button to create a new project.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-azure-devops-create-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure DevOps interface that shows the button to create a new project." border="true":::

1. Enter the details of your new project:

   - **Project name**: Enter a meaningful but short name. For this module, use `toy-website`.
   - **Description**: Include a description to help others understand the repository's purpose.
   - **Visibility**: You can use Azure DevOps to create public and private repositories. Create a private repository, because only people inside your organization should access your website's files. You can grant access to others later.

   After you're done, your project configuration should look like the following screenshot:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-azure-devops-new-project-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure DevOps interface that shows the configuration for the project to create." border="true":::

1. Select **Create**.

1. On the project page that appears, select the **Repos** menu item.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-azure-devops-repos-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure DevOps interface that shows the menu on the project page, with the Repos item highlighted." border="true":::

1. Make a note of the repository's URL. You can use the copy button to copy the URL. You'll use it shortly.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-azure-devops-repo-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Repos interface that shows the repository's details, with the repository's U R L highlighted." border="true":::

## Generate a Git password

When you work with Azure Repos from Visual Studio Code on macOS, you need to use a special password that's different from the password that you use to sign in.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Windows, skip to the next section, _Configure your local Git repository_.

1. Select the **Generate Git credentials** button.

   Azure Repos creates a random password for you to use.

1. Make a note of the **Password** value. You'll use it shortly.

::: zone-end

Keep your browser open. You'll check on the repository again later in this exercise.

## Configure your local Git repository

1. Ensure you're on the _main_ branch by entering the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

1. Enter the following command to integrate your local repository with the remote repository that you created. Replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL` with the URL that you saved earlier.

   ```bash
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
   ```

   Notice that you're using the command `git remote add` to create a new reference to a remote repository. You name the reference `origin`, which is the standard name.

1. Verify the remote was created.

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   The output will look like the example.

   ::: zone pivot="github"

   ```output
   origin  https://github.com/mygithubuser/toy-website.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/mygithubuser/toy-website.git (push)
   ```

   ::: zone-end

   ::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

   ```output
   origin https://myuser@dev.azure.com/myuser/toy-website/_git/toy-website (fetch)
   origin https://myuser@dev.azure.com/myuser/toy-website/_git/toy-website (push)
   ```

   ::: zone-end

## Push your changes by using the Git CLI

::: zone pivot="github"

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Because your current local branch is _main_, this command tells Git that your local _main_ branch _tracks_ the _main_ branch in your remote repository. It also _pushes_ the commits from your local repository to the remote repository.

1. This is the first time you've used this remote repository, so the terminal prompts you to select how to authenticate. Choose the option to use the browser.

1. Follow the instructions in the browser to sign in and authorize Visual Studio Code to access your GitHub repository.

1. In your terminal window, Git displays output similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Enumerating objects: 16, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (16/16), done.
   Delta compression using up to 8 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (16/16), 2.30 KiB | 785.00 KiB/s, done.
   Total 16 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.
   To https://github.com/mygithubuser/toy-website.git
    * [new branch]      main -> main
   Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
   ```

   This output indicates that Git successfully pushed the contents of your repository to the remote repository.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="azurerepos"

1. In the Visual Studio Code terminal, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Because your current local branch is _main_, this command tells Git that your local _main_ branch _tracks_ the _main_ branch in your remote repository. It also _pushes_ the commits from your local repository to the remote.

1. This is the first time you've used this repository, so you're prompted to sign in.

   If you're using Windows, enter the same credentials that you used to sign in to Azure DevOps earlier in this exercise.

   If you're using macOS, paste the password that you generated earlier in this exercise.

1. In your terminal window, Git displays output similar to the following example:

   ```output
   Enumerating objects: 16, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (16/16), done.
   Delta compression using up to 8 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.
   Writing objects: 100% (16/16), 2.30 KiB | 785.00 KiB/s, done.
   Total 16 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
   remote: Analyzing objects... (16/16) (5 ms)
   remote: Storing packfile... done (165 ms)
   remote: Storing index... done (75 ms)
   To https://dev.azure.com/myuser/toy-website/_git/toy-website
    * [new branch]      main -> main
   Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
   ```

   This output indicates that Git successfully pushed the contents of your repository to the remote repository.

::: zone-end

## Add a README file

Now that your colleagues will use your repository, it's important to create a _README.md_ file to help them understand what your repository is for and how they can get started.

1. Open **Explorer** in Visual Studio Code.

1. Add a new file at the root of your current folder structure, and name it _README.md_.

1. Copy the following text into the file:

   ```markdown
   # Toy company's website

   This repository contains the website for our toy company.

   ## How to use

   The Azure infrastructure is defined using [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep).

   To deploy the website's Azure resources, use the _deploy/main.bicep_ file.
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > This is a placeholder README file, so it doesn't have a lot of useful content. When you work with your own Git repositories, create a README file that helps someone understand how to get started with your code. Think of it as a lightweight manual for your project.

1. Save the file.

1. Stage and commit the file to your local Git repository. You can choose whether you commit by using the Git CLI or by using **Source Control** in Visual Studio Code.

## Push again by using Visual Studio Code

Now that you've committed a new file, you need to push your changes again so that the remote has the latest files. This time, you use Visual Studio Code to push to the remote repository.

1. Open **Source Control** in Visual Studio Code.

1. Select the icon with three dots on the right side of the **Source Control** toolbar, and then select **Push**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-vscode-push.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code that shows the Source Control menu, with the Push menu item highlighted." border="true":::

   Notice that you're not prompted to sign in again. Your credentials are shared between the Git CLI and Visual Studio Code.

::: zone pivot="github"

## Verify the changes in GitHub

Now that you've pushed your changes to your remote repository, you can inspect the contents of the repository on GitHub.

1. In your browser, refresh the repository's page.

1. Notice that the files you created are now listed, and your _README.md_ file is displayed.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/9-github-final.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the GitHub interface that shows the repository, including the folder and file structure." border="true":::

1. Browse through the GitHub interface to explore the files, and notice that your changes are all displayed. Because GitHub has the full list of changes to each file, you can even view the history of a file, just as you can when you work in Visual Studio Code.
