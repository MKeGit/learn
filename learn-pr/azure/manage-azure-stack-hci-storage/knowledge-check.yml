  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following characteristics is associated with the NVMe storage?"
    choices:
    - content: "It attaches directly to the PCIe Bus."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The NVMe storage uses SSDs that attach directly to the PCIe bus."
    - content: "It uses platters and read/write heads."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NVMe doesn't use magnetic media for storage."
    - content: "It offers lower I/O throughput than SSDs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NVMe offers higher IOPS and I/O throughput with lower latency than SSDs."
  - content: "When a combination of NVMe drives and HDDs is used, what's the default cache behavior?"
    choices:
    - content: "Read and write"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For HDDs, caching applies to both reads and writes."
    - content: "Read-only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For HDDs, caching isn't set to read-only."
    - content: "Write-only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For HDDs, caching isn't set to write-only."
  - content: "When a combination of NVMe drives and SSDs is used, what's the default cache behavior?"
    choices:
    - content: "Read and write"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For SSDs as capacity drives, caching isn't set to read and write."
    - content: "Read-only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For SSDs as capacity drives, caching isn't set to read-only."
    - content: "Write-only"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For SSDs as capacity drives, only writes are cached. This behavior is intended to reduce wear on the cache drives, as performance gains from caching SSD reads would be relatively limited."
  - content: "When a combination of NVMe drives, SSDs, and HDDs is used, what's the default cache behavior?"
    choices:
    - content: "NVMe provides caching to SSDs and HDDs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a combination of NVMe drives, SSDs, and HDDs is used, NVMe provides caching to SSDs and HDDs."
    - content: "NVMe drives and SSDs provide caching to HDDs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a combination of the three drives is used, NVMe drives and SSDs don't provide caching to HDDs."
    - content: "SSDs provide caching to NVMe drives and HDDs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a combination of NVMe drives, SSDs, and HDDs is used, SSDs don't provide caching to NVMe drives and HDDs."
  - content: "Which of the following configurations could most likely result in the stranded capacity of 5 TB?"
    choices:
    - content: "Three-way mirror on three-drive volume, containing two drives of 10 TB in size and one drive of 15 TB in size"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This configuration could result in a stranded capacity if the first 2 drives are full."
    - content: "Three-way mirror on four-drive volume, containing four drives of 5 TB in size"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This configuration wouldn't result in a stranded capacity of 5 TB."
    - content: "Three-way mirror on five-drive volume, containing five drives of 5 TB in size"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This configuration wouldn't result in a stranded capacity of 5 TB."
  - content: "What's the maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size?"
    choices:
    - content: "80 percent"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size is 80 percent."
    - content: "50 percent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size isn't 50 percent."
    - content: "10 percent"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The maximum configurable CSV in-memory cache size isn't 10 percent."
  - content: "Which technology provides the zero-copy networking functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "RDMA"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. RDMA provides the zero-copy networking functionality."
    - content: "RSS"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. RSS doesn't provide the zero-copy networking functionality."
    - content: "NVMe"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. NVMe is a storage technology."
  - content: "What's the amount of time after which the Health Service in Azure Stack HCI would retire a disk that becomes inaccessible?"
    choices:
    - content: "5 minutes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The amount of time after which the Health Service would retire a disk that becomes inaccessible isn't 5 minutes."
    - content: "10 minutes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The amount of time after which the Health Service would retire a disk that becomes inaccessible isn't 10 minutes."
    - content: "15 minutes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Health Service would retire a disk that becomes inaccessible after 15 minutes."
