Infrastructure as code, sometimes referred to as _IaC_, is a way to provision infrastructure resources that's similar to how software is deployed. These resources include virtual machines, virtual networks, and web applications. Infrastructure as code can help automate your deployments, increase confidence in your deployments, and increase efficiency and repeatability.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work as an Azure infrastructure administrator at a toy company that's experiencing significant growth in the global market. As a result, your infrastructure needs to scale with the company's growth, including:

- Deployments of new applications for internal teams and customers.
- Multiple region deployments to support your customers and partners around the world.
- Multiple environment deployments to ensure consistency.

Evaluate whether infrastructure as code might be a valuable approach to resource provisioning at your company. You also need to decide which technology to use when you deploy your Azure infrastructure.

## What we cover?

This module covers the concepts of infrastructure as code and its benefits. The modules covers the purpose of Terraform as an infrastructure as code language and understand how it works. The module answers these questions:

- What is infrastructure as code?
- Why infrastructure as code help you automate resource provisioning?
- What is Terraform and how does it work?
- Why should you use Terraform instead of other tooling options?

## What is the main goal?

After completing this module, you'll be able to determine whether infrastructure as code is the right approach and tool for your organization.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with:

- Basic cloud computing concepts and terminology.
- Different types of cloud resources.
