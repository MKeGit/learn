Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and multicloud data. The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog is an application within the service that helps users find useful data in your organization using a search experience based on their permissions.

   "In the Microsoft Purview governance portal architecture, on-premises, cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data sources are flowing into the Data Map. The map is at the bottom of the stack inside the Microsoft Purview governance portal. Data Catalog and Data Estate Insights sit on top of the data map, and on top of those applications are data producers and consumers. Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL Server, Power BI, and Azure SQL are shown extracting data from all levels of the Microsoft Purview governance portal stack."

The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog is one of two main pillars in Microsoft Purview that sits atop the Microsoft Purview Data Map. The data map scans resources and houses metadata about the assets in those resources. The data catalog makes this metadata accessible to your users without sacrificing security. Users can search and browse data assets to find relevant information based on the kind of data, or even on its context in your business.

The data catalog helps answer questions like:

- What kind of data is this?
- Where does it come from?
- Who can I contact if I have more questions?
- Where can I find a data set that has X, Y, and Z attributes?
- What is this data set about?
- Is this data up to date?

## Trustworthy data

The data catalog also allows you to mark and manage trustworthy data sets, so your users know which sources are up to date and ready for use. You can do this using a **certified** flag that can be applied by data stewards in Microsoft Purview, and allows users to find quality data on their own without data stewards needing to field regular questions.

## Using the catalog across Azure

The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog also allows users to search for data where they need it. If you register your Microsoft Purview instance to an Azure Data Factory or an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, your users can search the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog directly from those services to find the data they need.

## Scenario

The Fabrikam Corp shoe company expanded rapidly over the last year. Growing from a handful of employees and a single data lake, to a multi-regional business with data across several platforms. [In the module before this one, they created a Microsoft Purview proof of concept](/learn/modules/deploy-microsoft-purview-scan-data-resources/) where they scanned one of their data sources. Now they need to know how to use the data catalog to see what kind of information Microsoft Purview discovered. They also need to start their data governance lifecycle by curating and managing these data assets to give their users more context.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, we explore the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog's main features:

- Search and browse data assets
- Manage data assets
- Create and curate a business glossary

By the end of this session, you're able to use the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog to discover and manage data assets across your data estate, all from within Microsoft Purview.
