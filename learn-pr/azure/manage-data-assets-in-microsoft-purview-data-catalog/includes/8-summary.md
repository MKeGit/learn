In this module, we explored data assets that we scanned into our data catalog in Microsoft Purview. We also discussed how we can manage and modify those assets.

Now that your proof of concept includes certified assets and a business glossary, it's easier for other users to explore your data assets to find information they need in your data catalog. You're one step closer to a mature data governance solution that allows you to manage and use data across your entire data estate!
