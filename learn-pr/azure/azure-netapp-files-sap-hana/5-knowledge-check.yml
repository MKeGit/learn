  questions:
  - content: Which of the following options isn't a benefit of using application volume groups for Azure NetApp Files?
    choices:
    - content: One step deployment of your single-host SAP HANA system
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. In addition to low latency and high-provisioning, one-step deployment of your single-host SAP HANA system is a key benefit of using application volume groups. 
    - content: Automatic QoS provisioning
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. You must use manual QoS with application volume groups. 
    - content: Low latency and high provisioning
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Low latency and high-provisioning as well as one-step deployment of your single-host SAP HANA system are key benefits of using application volume groups. 
  - content: SAP HANA systems require low latency and high performance. Azure NetApp Files volumes deployed using application volume group meet this demand in concert with proximity placement groups. What role do proximity placement groups serve?
    choices: 
    - content: Determine throughput limits on your SAP HANA system
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Although application volume groups help you configure throughput options, they don't configure limits. 
    - content: Ensure compute resources are placed adjacently to ensure storage performance and low latency
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct Application volume groups low latency ensures performance requirements are met by selecting optimal volume placement.
    - content: Determine the region of your Azure NetApp Files deployment
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Application volume group ensures compute and storage resources are placed adjacently. You select the region of deployment. 
  - content: Before requesting pinning, you must first.
    choices: 
    - content: Create a volume
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: Mount a VM  
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect.
    - content: Create an empty AvSet
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. 
  - content: When you create a capacity pool for your application volume group, what type of Quality of Service should you use?
    choices: 
    - content: Manual
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. Capacity pools for application volume groups must be configured with manual QoS. 
    - content: Ultra 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure NetApp Files offers two types of QoS - manual and auto. Capacity pools for application volume groups must be configured with manual QoS.
    - content: Auto 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. Capacity pools for application volume groups must be configured with manual QoS.
  - content: When you delegate a subnet for your application volume group, what size should you use?
    choices: 
    - content: /24
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: Correct. 
    - content: /25 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. You should use a /24 subnet. 
    - content: /26 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: Incorrect. You should use a /24 subnet.
