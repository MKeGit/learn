Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is similar to Microsoft Azure in that it offers a growing range of AI, compute, storage, database, and other services. While both platforms have similarities in their capabilities, the implementations of cloud services are often different. When planning a migration for some or all of your workloads, you need to understand important concepts, such as identity and access management (IAM), governance, IaaS services, storage, and more.

Suppose you work for a global cycling retailer. Until recently, you hosted most of your business-critical systems on GCP but a merger with a retailing competitor requires you to understand their cloud systems. The competitors cloud systems are hosted on Azure. You want to investigate the differences and similarities between Azure and GCP and determine how systems equivalent to your GCP architecture can be deployed in Azure.

In this module, you learn about key areas in Azure, and how they map to Google Cloud services.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you're able to:

- Understand identity and access management (IAM) in Azure compared to GCP.
- Compare governance services on GCP with Azure.
- Understand the differences between GCP and Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) options.
- Compare database services in GCP with Azure.
- Compare event driven architecture and messaging services in GCP and Azure.
- Compare Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
- Understand where to find more information about GCP equivalent Azure services.
