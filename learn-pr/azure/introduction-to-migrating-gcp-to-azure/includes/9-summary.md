Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are competing solutions to the challenges of cloud computing. They take different approaches and have different terminologies and can confuse IT professionals who work with both. In this module, you saw how features of Google Cloud can be mapped to their equivalent in Azure and how architects can understand migrations from one to the other.

Throughout this module, you've been considering the scenario of two cycling equipment companies, using Google Cloud and Azure, who consider migrating their cloud systems after a merger. You can now see how Google Cloud services, such as Google Kubernetes Engine or Bigtable. Map to Azure services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service or Cosmos DB. However, migration isn't a simple lift-and-shift operation. You saw some of the differences in terminology and structure.

After completing this module, you can:

- Understand identity and access management (IAM) in Azure compared to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Compare governance services on GCP with Azure.
- Understand the differences between GCP and Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) options.
- Compare database services in GCP with Azure.
- Compare event driven architecture and messaging services in GCP and Azure.
- Compare Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).
- Understand where to find more information about GCP equivalent Azure services.
