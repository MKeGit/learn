In the previous exercise, you prepared your Azure Resource Manager template files with your unique information, such as your tenantID. 

In this exercise, you use those Azure Resource Manager templates for one deployment, and then you use the template files on GitHub for the remaining two customer deployments.

As the administrator for Contoso, onboard three new customers using the following methods:

- **Customer 1** requires a subscription-level deployment of your Azure Resource Manager templates, using PowerShell.

- **Customer 2** requires a deployment to one resource group, called **"cust2-rg1"**, which you can action from GitHub. You need the unique information you gathered earlier, such as your tenantID, but the lab provides instructions for deployment.

- **Customer 3** requires a deployment to two resource groups, called **"cust3-rg1"** and **"cust3-rg2"**. You can action this deployment from GitHub, again adding your unique information during the deployment process.

> After you complete the deployment exercises in this lab, **DO NOT CLOSE THE LAB ENVIRONMENT.** Instead, keep the lab running in a separate window, return to this course and continue with the next unit.
