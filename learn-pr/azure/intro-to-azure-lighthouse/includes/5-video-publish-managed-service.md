Contoso is now comfortable providing Azure Resource Manager templates to new customers when they sign a service contract. Now you want to grow and scale your Azure Lighthouse managed service offering to new customers. Azure Lighthouse provides two means of onboarding Azure customers. 

## Get started

With Azure Lighthouse, you can create a service offer and publish it to the Azure Marketplace. If you already have experience with publishing offers to the Azure Marketplace, there's almost no difference in publishing a service offer that uses Azure Lighthouse.

### Partner Center account

In order to create a service offer, you need a valid Partner Center account. If you don't have one, you need to [sign up and enroll in the Commercial Marketplace program](/azure/marketplace/create-account).

### Public and private offers

When defining an Azure Marketplace managed service offer, you need to decide the target audience for the offer. It depends on the type of offer you make: public or private.

- **Public**: offers of this type are visible to all Azure Marketplace users; typically, this type is used to gain new customers.
- **Private**: offers of this type are only visible to named Azure Customers; typically, this type of offer is used for existing known customers.

## The walk-through

Since not everyone can access Partner Center, this unit showcases how to create and publish a service offer to the Azure Marketplace through a video walk-through.

This content looks at:

- The steps needed to create a managed service offer
- The difference between private and public offers
- How to configure manifest details
