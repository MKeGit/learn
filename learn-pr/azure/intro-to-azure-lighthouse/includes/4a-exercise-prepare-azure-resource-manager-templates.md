## Exercise scenarios

As the administrator for Contoso, you're responsible for onboarding three new customers:

- **Customer 1** has a services contract for Contoso to manage and administer their entire Azure subscription and all of its resources. To achieve this, Contoso staff needs *Contributor* access to the customer's subscription.

- **Customer 2's** service contract requires *Reader* access to one resource group, called **"cust2-rg1"**.

- **Customer 3's** service contract requires *Reader* access to two resource groups in the same subscription, **"cust3-rg1"** and **"cust3-rg2"**.

In the opened lab, create a security group for your Contoso staff and prepare your Azure Resource Manager template files with your specific tenant and principal ID information. Save your template files so you can use them in the next exercise, where you'll onboard your customers.
