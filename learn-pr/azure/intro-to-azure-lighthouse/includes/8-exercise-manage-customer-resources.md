In this exercise, you manage the resources of Contoso's customers in three different scenarios.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Return to the lab environment you have open from the previous exercise, since it contains pre-requisites needed for these scenarios.

### Enable Azure Backup

You detected that a customer's virtual machine isn't being backed up. As a Contoso staff member using your own credentials, you can enable Azure Backup for that virtual machine.

### Add a new Azure resource

Next, you were asked to add a new storage account to a customer's subscription. This activity shows the effect of your delegated access role, which prevents you from actioning tasks outside the scope of that role.

### Deploy Azure Policy to customers at scale

Finally, Contoso has recommended that all customers use secure transfer methods for their storage accounts. This recommendation means that storage accounts should only accept requests from secure connections that use HTTPS. You'll use PowerShell to deploy an Azure Policy to all of your customers' subscriptions, which enforce HTTPS for storage accounts.

On completion of these final exercises, you can close the lab environment.
