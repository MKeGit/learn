A data product landing zone serves as a design area where all data products could be hosted. A data product brings all siloed, hidden, nondiscoverable data together in a systematic domain-driven approach. It makes the dataset available to the consumer as a high-quality data asset. A data product is similar to a software product that has an owner. The business values it serves is in the form of data as a business critical service.

## Significance

At a high level, data products are computed or polyglot persistence services that might be required depending on certain use cases. A data product is anything that drives business value; for example, reports, workbooks, bespoke database, or data API. A data product can use other services and technologies that aren't part of data landing zone core services. Data products fulfill a specific need within a business. Data products manage, organize, and make sense of the data across domains and present the insights gained from the data products.

Examples of Data Products include:

- Functions
- App Service
- Logic Apps
- Azure Analysis Services
- Azure AI services
- Azure Machine Learning
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Cosmos Database

A data product is a result of data from one or many data integrations and/or other data products.

## Cross-product flow

A data product could also use data services from other data products and provide a composite product, as in the following diagram:

Here's an example of a data product for a banking use case:
