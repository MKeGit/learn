The data landing zone is classified as a hosting area for data-centric workloads. It's always connected to the data-management landing zone via networking components to allow for centralized governance and monitoring.

## Significance

A data landing zone has several layers to enable agility of service data integrations and data products within it.

[![Diagram of the data landing zone core.](../media/data-landing-zone-core.png)](../media/data-landing-zone-core.png)

These layers are:

- **Core Services Layer**: Provides plumbing and foundational services.
- **Data Integration Layer**: Provides a gateway for ingesting and enriching data from external sources.
- **Data Product Layer**: Provides a path to host and build data as a product with well-defined ownership within an enterprise.
- **Data Visualization Layer**: Provides a path to host and build a data consumption service.

Let's discuss each layer.

### Core Services

Core Services is deployed in a separate resource group. The first service is the networking, which consists of Network Security Groups, Network Watcher, and Virtual Network. The Virtual Network is automatically peered with the Data Management Landing Zone VNet and Connectivity Subscription VNet.

The second is the Enterprise Data Lake, which consists of an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 instance to store data in three zones (namely Raw, Curated & enriched, and Workspace). This pattern enables best-practice data separation and unlocks use cases on advanced data analytics and AI/ML. A separate space is also allocated to absorb any staging of data from external sources.

The third is logging and monitoring for centralized logging and monitoring.

The fourth is the metadata service, the main objective of which is to enable storing business metadata and capturing technical metadata. The technical metadata is captured through the Microsoft Purview instance in the Data Management landing zone. This layer consists of a virtual machine to function as a self-hosted integration runtime the Microsoft Purview instance uses. The types of data that you'll store in the data landing zone help determine any other services that should be there. For example, if you're storing sensitive (personal) data, you might include a tokenization engine. The tokenization engine ensures that all sensitive data can be tokenized as it's ingested into the data lake. An Azure Database for MySQL database will be provisioned. The Azure Databricks engineering workspaces and Azure Databricks analytics and data science workspace use it as their external Apache Hive meta store.
  
The fifth layer is upload-ingest storage to enable storing any data from third-party publishers. Third-party data publishers need to land their data into the platform so integration ops can pull it into their Data Lakes.

The sixth layer is for data ingesting and processing, to enable automatic data ingestion using various technologies. The service generally consists of an instance of Azure Databricks. It could also use Event Hubs or IoT Hub for real-time streaming to Event Hubs.

The last two layers are shared integration and shared products, to enable shared services used across multiple data warehouses for fast data integration.

### Data Products

Data Products are compute or polyglot persistence services that might be required depending on the use case. We therefore expect multiple resource groups by data product. Data products fulfill a specific need within a business. Data products manage, organize, and make sense of the data across domains and present the insights gained from the data products. A data product is a result of data from one or many data integrations and/or other data products.

### Data Integration

A data integration is responsible for data ingestion and enrichment only from external sources such as metrics, finance, and CRM. This layer can operate in both real time, batch and microbatch. This layer is a special type of data product, and it's represented as an empty resource group.

We'll cover the details of Data Integration in the next unit.

### Data Visualization

For every data landing zone, an empty visualization resource group is created. This group can be filled with services required to implement your visualization solution.
