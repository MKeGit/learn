In this module, you learned about the building blocks of enterprise-scale data management and analytics.

Azure landing zones represent the strategic design path and target technical state for your environment. The landing zones are for ease of deployment and governance, and to provide greater agility and compliance. They also ensure that when a new application or workload lands in your environment, the proper "plumbing" is already in place.

Azure data management and data landing zones help to enable:

- Self-service
- Scalability
- Fast start
- Security
- Privacy
- Optimized operations

The data management landing zone provides the foundation for your platform's centralized data governance and management across your organization. It also facilitates communication to ingest data from your entire digital estate, including multicloud and hybrid infrastructures. It supports numerous other data management and governance capabilities:

- Data catalog
- Data classification
- Data lineage
- Data quality management
- Data modeling repository
- Master data management
- API catalog
- Data sharing and contracts

Data landing zones are defined by domain to bring data closer to users. They enable self-service while maintaining common management and governance via connection to the data management landing zone. They host standard services like networking, monitoring, and data ingestion and processing, as well as customizations like data integrations, data products, and visualizations.

Data landing zones are key to enabling your platform's scalability. Depending on your organization's size and needs, you can start with one or multiple landing zones.  

When deciding between single and multiple landing zones, consider regional dependencies and data-residency requirements. Are there any local laws or regulations that require data to stay in a specific location?

Regardless of your initial decision, you can add or remove data landing zones as needed. If you're starting with one, we recommend that you plan to extend to multiple to avoid future migration needs.
