The Azure CLI is a good choice for anyone new to Azure command line and scripting. Its simple syntax and cross-platform compatibility help reduce the risk of errors when performing regular and repetitive tasks. In this module, you used the Azure CLI commands to create a resource group and deploy a web app by using a small set of commands. You could combine these commands into a shell script as part of an automation solution.
