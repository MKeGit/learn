## App description

Conceptualize and develop an app that uses the capabilities of the HoloLens 2. The app should provide a valuable and engaging experience to its users. The project offers flexibility in choosing the app domain, whether it's education, healthcare, gaming, engineering, or any other relevant field. You should define the purpose, features, and target audience of the app.

## Galaxy Explorer example for app description

Galaxy Explorer is an educational application built for the HoloLens 2 to inspire and educate people about the galaxy. With spatial technology, a person can see the entire galaxy in the room they are in. The app provides 3D models of planets, allow users to navigate through space, and offer educational information about each celestial body.

This app is supported on the following platforms:

- HoloLens 2
- HoloLens (first gen)
- Windows Mixed Reality Headsets (VR)
- Windows 10 Desktop

## Storyboard for the app

Create a detailed storyboard that outlines the user experience and interaction flow of the app. Storyboarding helps visualize the different stages and screens within the app, showcasing how users navigate and engage with the MR elements. The storyboard should demonstrate a logical progression and highlight key interactions, interfaces, and functionalities. Think of a storyboard as a low-fidelity comic book with panels that show how a user uses your app. It isn't comprehensive, but should convey the structure of your app.

## Galaxy Explorer example for storyboard

A storyboard consists of how many panels need to convey what the project is and the needs to detail interaction, etc. Most storyboards start with the initial screen as you see in this image:

Notice that it isn't a finished rendering of the initial experience but gives an idea of what you see in the Galaxy Explorer app with enough fidelity. That way if you're having stakeholders review it, any changes cost less as much as your only dealing with mock-ups of the user interface.

Another type of panel within your storyboard is where you can explore interactions you may want to include. For example, you create an exploration of an interaction instead of a full-fidelity interaction.

There are many tools from PowerPoint to Figma that make it easy to create storyboards for your project that you can use, but even pencil and paper make for a great tool to create storyboards.
