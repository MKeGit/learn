The project includes a functional app prototype that is ready for the Microsoft Store. The intention isn't a hands-on tutorial with code included of building an app, but the holistic approach to building an app end-to-end.

Also, the other deliverable in addition to the prototype is a project document.

## Galaxy Explorer

To help you make sure that you don't start with the "blank canvas problem," we use the [Galaxy Explorer sample app](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/galaxy-explorer-update). If you also want to download the code, you can [download it from GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/GalaxyExplorer). Note, for brevity purposes, it's not a comprehensive specification you would normally do for a professional app, instead we're providing a minimal viable example of each section to get you started!

Although you could just recreate the Galaxy Explorer, you should build an app that is most interesting to you or solves a specific problem you have. Again, the Galaxy Explorer is just to provide a guiding sample to give you ideas and suggestions.

## Project document and the sections to be included

The project document should have the following sections, they're discussed in detail through the rest of the learning module:

- App Description
- Storyboard
- Design Considerations
- Environmental Considerations
- Accessibility Considerations
- Privacy Considerations
- Development Workflow
- App Prototype
