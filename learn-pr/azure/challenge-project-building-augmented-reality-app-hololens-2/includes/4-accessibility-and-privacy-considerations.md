## Accessibility considerations

Address accessibility needs to ensure inclusivity in the app design. Consider factors such as font size, color contrast, audio alternatives for visual cues, and navigation options for users with disabilities. Test the app's accessibility features to ensure usability for individuals with diverse abilities.

## Galaxy Explorer example for accessibility considerations

The Galaxy Explorer takes into consideration accessibility with the following items:

- The use of voice commands that match to the buttons in the menu experience. So instead of having to manipulate the Tilt button to change the degree of view, instead the user can just say "tilt" to activate it.
- For visual impaired people, a zoom feature was built in and audio narration.
- The app also takes advantage of the HoloLens operating system and all the accessibility features built in.

## Privacy considerations

Pay attention to privacy concerns associated with the collection and usage of user data. Design the app to prioritize user privacy and data protection. Clearly communicate the app's data handling practices, obtain user consent when required, and ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations.

## Galaxy Explorer example for privacy considerations

The Galaxy Explorer app doesn't ask for any personal data nor stores any personal data. Because the microphone is used for accessibility considerations, the application provides a microphone use dialog. The app itself also has a [privacy policy](https://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
