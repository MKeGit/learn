Building immersive and reliable experiences requires a thorough understanding of application quality assurance. As you implement the design concepts explored in this module, itâ€™s imperative that you consider the following app quality criteria:

**Frame rate** - Frame rate below the recommended targets can cause holograms to appear jittery, negatively impacting the believability of the experience and potentially causing eye fatigue.

**Hologram stability** - Stable holograms increase the usability and believability of your app and create a more comfortable viewing experience for the user.

**Holograms position on real surfaces** - Misalignments of holograms with physical objects (if intended to be placed in relation to one another) are a clear indication of the nonunion of holograms and real-world.

**Viewing zone of comfort** - Improper content depth can lead to visual discomfort or fatigue.

**Depth switching** - Demands for the user to switch frequently or quickly between near and far focal objects (including holograms and real-world content) can lead to oculomotor fatigue, and general discomfort.

**Use of spatial sound** - Using spatial sound in an application allows developers to convincingly place sounds in a 3-dimensional space (sphere) all around the user. Those sounds seem as if they're coming from real physical objects or the mixed reality holograms in the user's surroundings.

**Focus on holographic frame field of view boundaries** - Mitigating the effect of the field of view (FOV) boundaries involves a thoughtful design of content scale and context, use of spatial audio, guidance systems, and the user's position.

**Content reacts to user position** - Designing an app that correctly adapts to user position creates a more believable experience and make it easier to use.

**Input interaction clarity** - Input interaction clarity is critical to an app's usability and includes input consistency, approachability, discoverability of interaction methods.

**Interactable objects** - Interactable objects should be clearly recognizable by the user through visual and audio cues.

**Room scanning** - If the user is required to scan the environment, clear guidance should be provided during the scanning experience.

**Directional indicators** - A well-designed app makes it easier for the user to find nonvisible content. Directional indicators alert a user to important content and provide guidance to the content relative to the user's position.

We recommend reviewing the App Quality Criteria guide for more information on evaluating and measuring quality.
