Great samples inspire and motivate us to create wonders in mixed reality. It's always good to have something to guide you through the design process. Looking through examples can also spark new design ideas. Here are a few sample applications created in mixed reality to help you before starting your design journey.

## MRTK Examples Hub

In the previous units, we explored some powerful features of MRTK. However, it would be time-consuming to examine each of these features individually. MRTK provides its users with the MRTK Examples Hub. The MRTK Examples Hub is a Unity scene that makes it easy to experience multiple scenes. These scenes contain all the necessary information about a particular feature of MRTK.

MRTK Examples Hub uses MRTKs Scene System to load and unload the scenes so that users can easily switch scenes. **MRTKExamplesHub.unity** is the container scene with shared components, including shared components MixedRealityToolkit and MixedRealityPlayspace. **MRTKExamplesHubMainMenu.unity** scene has the cube buttons.

If you have HoloLens 2 device, you can directly download and install the app<sup>15</sup> on your device.

## Designing Holograms

The Designing Holograms application allows you to gain hands-on experience with mixed reality UX design principles. Learning how to design in mixed reality can be tricky. As described in earlier chapters, the medium doesn't always transition well from the 2D design process. The Designing Holograms app takes a new approach to exploring mixed reality behaviors, suggestions, and recommendations to help you design your own engaging and stunning HoloLens applications.

Download the app<sup>16</sup> for free from the Microsoft Store and learn from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Team!

## HoloLens Playground

The HoloLens Playground is a fun application and a great place for developers to understand what's possible with the Mixed Reality Toolkit. You can experience new and intuitive ways of interacting with holograms in a mixed reality playground. For example, you can summon a hummingbird to your outstretched hand, play the piano with all your fingers, and use your eyes in some magical ways. This application is an exciting way to learn about MRTK.

You can download HoloLens Playground<sup>17</sup> in the Microsoft Store.

## Galaxy Explorer

The Galaxy Explorer is one of the first mixed reality experiences for many. It was created as an open-source application for HoloLens (first version) through the Share Your Idea initiative. Currently, it's up-to-date for HoloLens 2.

:::image type="content" source="../media/galaxy-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the galaxy explorer app." lightbox="../media/galaxy-explorer.png":::

This project primarily uses the framework and tools like MRTK for its development. The entire project is accessible via GitHub by the developer communities. This project adopts the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct<sup>18</sup>.

The supported platforms for this project are HoloLens 2, HoloLens (1st gen), Windows Mixed Reality Headsets (VR), and Windows 10 Desktop.

The project is available on GitHub<sup>19</sup>, so give it a try! You can also go through the documented case study for the application here<sup>20</sup>.

## Surfaces

The Surfaces app is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. It demonstrates how to use the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK)'s input system and building blocks to create an app experience for HoloLens 2. It explores how we can create a tactile sensation with visual, audio, and fully articulated hand-tracking. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/surfaces.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the surfaces app." lightbox="../media/surfaces.png":::

In this project, you can find the examples of:

* Use MRTKs Input System<sup>21</sup>, specifically hand / joint tracking.
* Use MRTKs Standard Shader<sup>2</sup> for performant graphics.

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences. Download the app package<sup>22</sup> from GitHub and try it yourself.

## Periodic Table

Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs released an open-source sample app called the Periodic Table of Elements. The app was created in 2015 to demonstrate how to create an end-to-end experience utilizing MRTKs building blocks for the HoloLens (1st gen) and immersive headsets. In addition, the software is upgraded to use MRTK v2 to properly use the new articulated hand tracking and eye-tracking input on HoloLens 2.

:::image type="content" source="../media/periodic-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the periodic table app." lightbox="../media/periodic-table.png":::

The Periodic Table of the Elements displays chemical elements and their properties in three dimensions. It includes fundamental HoloLens interactions such as gaze and air tap. In addition, animated 3D models let users learn about the elements. Users can visualize a chemical element's electron shell and nucleus, consisting of protons and neutrons.

In this project, you can find the examples of:

* Using MRTKs Input System<sup>21</sup>.
* Laying out an array of objects in 3D space with various surface types using MRTKs Object Collection<sup>23</sup>.
* Creating objects that respond to the standard inputs using MRTKs Interactable<sup>24</sup>.
* Using the MRTK Button<sup>25</sup>.
* Using the MRTK Object Manipulator<sup>26</sup>.
* Using the MRTK Hand Menu<sup>27</sup>.
* Loading and parsing local JSON file data using Unity's JsonUtility.

You can use this project's components to create your own mixed reality app experiences. Download the app package<sup>28</sup> from GitHub and try it yourself.
