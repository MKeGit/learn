In mixed reality, the typical 2D design approach begins to break down. For most people, comprehending concepts in 3D is challenging. Two-dimensional tools like pencils, paper, or whiteboards can often constrain ideas. 3D tools designed for gaming or engineering require a high level of expertise to flesh out concepts quickly. In addition, the technical uncertainty of new gadgets increases the shortage of lightweight design tools, which are still developing core interaction mechanisms. These obstacles might limit the design contributions of team members with 3D development skills and the team's ability to evolve significantly.

The iterative design process involves the following steps:

1. Come up with an idea.
2. Express the idea to your team members.
3. Have your team members evaluate the idea.
4. Decide whether to include the idea in the implementation.

In addition to the knowledge of designing applications for desktops, phones, and tablets, we need to refine this design process for mixed reality.

## Techniques for expanding the design process

The mixed reality design process involves different roles and disciplines that aren't limited to 3D designers and developers. Team members without particular 3D expertise can still contribute before the prototype phase with techniques covered in this section. These approaches help to complement and not replace the existing application design process. Later in development, we might discover new opportunities and problems.

These techniques are:

- **Bodystorming**: Bodystorming is a technique for developing interactions, digital objects, user interfaces, and animations with the help of craft materials. You can use props like paper, wires, and clay to test the intended experience before diving into any 3D application. Also, this technique can save lots of time observing how users interact with the physical objects without prototyping directly in 3D.
- **Acting and feedback**: The next stage is to walk through an experience with these objects following bodystorming. This stage is called acting, and the designer typically simulates how a user might proceed through an experience or a specific interaction.
- **Storyboarding**: A storyboard represents how your story unfolds scene by scene. Storyboarding works behind the scenes in movie and video game creation. Like a script, storyboarding visually guides you throughout the production process. The storyboarding approach aids in conveying both the general flow of an experience and its aesthetic appearance and feel.

## The design process

The design process usually starts with whiteboarding and progresses to bodystorming and acting. Before starting with the prototyping and asset creation, you need to have a solid storyboard with a **One Line Concept**. The one line concept is a high-level definition of what the storyboard is trying to achieve. Mixed reality design often involves figuring out physical user interactions before getting into the development stage.

The entire design process can be challenging and messy. In addition, it's a continuous and repetitive process that needs numerous revisions and revisits. The techniques mentioned in this unit can ease the process and provide you with the right direction. Here are two ways to get on with the design process efficiently.

- **Building your design team's skills**: The biggest strength comes from a team stepping out of their comfort zone and developing skills that give them more involvement throughout the development process. Their skills shouldn't be limited to design or development.

  The design process is all about feedback and iteration. Unfortunately, for mixed reality applications, the feedback received often requires technical knowledge in 3D development. Therefore, equipping your team with knowledge of Unity or Unreal helps them to understand the developers' approaches and provide more effective feedback during prototyping. Likewise, it's helpful for developers to understand some fundamental UX concepts (and potential design pitfalls) of mixed reality experiences, which can offer implementation insights early in the design phase.

  Design teams are encouraged to learn new skills. Tools such as Unity, Maya, Cinema 4D, Unreal Engine, Substance Painter/Designer, and other 3D modeling software. While these skills are requirements for today's mixed reality experiences, there will undoubtedly be many specialized tools, and abilities required to develop tomorrow's ground-breaking applications.

- **Explore mixed reality**: Understanding various mixed reality concepts helps you boost your design. As discussed earlier, the process is more complicated compared to the typical design process of 2D applications. Whether it's bodystorming, acting, reviewing with experts, or storyboarding, these techniques are meant to save you time and effort. While we're still in the early stages of HoloLens and virtual reality development, including mixed reality in your design process allows your team to focus on solving new and challenging design problems rather than resolving communication issues.
