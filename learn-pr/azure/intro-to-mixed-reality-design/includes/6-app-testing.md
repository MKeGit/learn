Testing plays a vital role in identifying and resolving issues that could affect user experience, performance, and compatibility.

## Using Visual Studio to deploy and debug

Visual Studio is considered the goto tool for debugging and deployment. HoloLens apps can be deployed from Visual Studio either over Wi-Fi or USB. The Visual Studio profiling tools allow you to analyze your app's performance and resource use. The profiling tool includes tools to optimize CPU, memory, graphics, and network use. You can also use Visual Studio to debug an installed Universal Windows app without deploying from a Visual Studio project. This method is useful if you want to debug an installed app package or debug an app that's already running.

## Testing your app on HoloLens 2

After your HoloLens 2 app is deployed to the device, you can activate the app and interact with it to evaluate its performance, comfort, and input. We recommend testing your app in as many different spaces as possible. Consider changes in light conditions, motions, and distances. Ensure that the hologram interactions work with your chosen interaction model. You could also integrate telemetry and analytics into your app to get insights from your Beta testers and end users. Pay attention to features, interactions, and user interface elements, ensuring they work as intended in the mixed reality environment.

## Using the HoloLens Emulator

The HoloLens Emulator replicates the HoloLens environment, allowing you to test applications on your PC without the need for a physical HoloLens. Once you deploy your app to the HoloLens Emulator, you can interact with the app using the keyboard, mouse, or an Xbox controller. You control the emulator by directing the actions of a simulated user wearing a HoloLens. Your actions move the simulated user around the environment. You can also use the emulatorâ€™s virtual rooms to expand your testing in different environments.
