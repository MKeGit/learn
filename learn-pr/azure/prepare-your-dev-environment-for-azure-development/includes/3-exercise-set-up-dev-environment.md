To use Visual Studio Code for Azure development, you'll need to install Visual Studio Code locally and one or more Azure extensions. In this exercise, we'll add the **Azure App Service** extension.

## Install Visual Studio Code

To install Visual Studio Code, use the appropriate steps for your operating system.

### Windows

1. [Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. Run the installer.

1. Open Visual Studio Code by pressing the Windows key or selecting the Windows icon on the task bar, typing "Visual Studio Code" and selecting the **Visual Studio Code** result.

### macOS

1. [Download Visual Studio Code for macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. Double-click the downloaded archive to expand the contents.

1. Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder.

1. Open Visual Studio Code by selecting the icon the Apps section or by searching for Visual Studio Code in Spotlight.

### Linux

#### Debian and Ubuntu

1. Download and install the [.deb package (64-bit)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868) through the graphical software center (if it's available) or through the command line (replacing `<file>` with the .deb filename you downloaded):

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f # Install dependencies
   ```

#### RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS

> [!CAUTION]
> This content references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and plan accordingly. For more information, see the [CentOS End Of Life guidance](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/centos/centos-end-of-life).

1. Use the following script to install the key and repository:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo'
   ```

1. Update the package cache and install the package by using dnf (Fedora 22 and above):

   ```bash
   dnf check-update
   sudo dnf install code
   ```

#### openSUSE and SLE

1. The yum repository also works for openSUSE and SLE-based systems. The following script will install the key and repository:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ntype=rpm-md\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/vscode.repo'
   ```

1. Update the package cache and install the package by using:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper refresh
   sudo zypper install code
   ```
