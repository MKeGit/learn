Visualizing assets in an immersive setting lets you experience the right data in the right context at the right time. Adding connectivity of your assets to operations data makes your assets more intelligent and reflective of physical assets or processes.

## Example scenario

In this scenario, each of the wind turbines in your wind farm needs to be connected to a simulated data stream representing real-world Internet of Things (IoT) data feeds. You want each turbine user interface (UI) panel to react to events, display operational information, and have the map focus on the selected turbine in the scene.

## What are we doing?

In this unit, you connect your wind turbines to a stream of Azure Digital Twins data for visualization and interaction in mixed reality. This ability is the true power of the Azure Digital Twins service.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you can connect real-world operating data to digital assets, using live or historic IoT data, which allows you to:

- Visualize operating conditions
- Identify anomalies in performance or equipment health and integrity
- Determine trends and patterns in data over time
- Simulate future conditions or operations situations
