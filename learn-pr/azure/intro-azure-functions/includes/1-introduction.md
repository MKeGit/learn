Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

The features of Azure Functions allow you to:

- **Use your preferred language**: Write functions in C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, or use a custom handler to use virtually any other language.

- **Automate deployment**: From a tools-based approach to using external pipelines, there's a myriad of deployment options available.

- **Troubleshoot a function**: Use monitoring tools and testing strategies to gain insights into your apps.

- **Take advantage of flexible pricing options**: With the Consumption plan, you only pay while your functions are running, while the Premium and App Service plans offer features for specialized needs.

## Example scenario

You own a business, and you want to send a holiday greeting email to your customers. Instead of building a website and deploying and hosting it just for one feature, you want to use an Azure function, add your email sign-in details in the function, and then deploy it to Azure. The function connects to the data source, gets your customers' email information, and sends them an email on a scheduled date and time.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn:

- What Azure Functions is and how you interact with it.
- What the key components of Azure Functions are and how it works.
- What the strengths of Azure Functions are and how to best use the service.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you should be able to describe the Azure Functions service, what it consists of, how it works, and when to use it.
