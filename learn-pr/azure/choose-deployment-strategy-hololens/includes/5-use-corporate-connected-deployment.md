Let's consider a manufacturing company that aims to revolutionize its operations using HoloLens 2 devices. The company envisions using mixed reality to enhance production efficiency, provide real-time data to workers, and improve collaboration among teams.

In this scenario, a corporate network deployment strategy for HoloLens 2 would be highly suitable. The devices are connected to the company's internal Wi-Fi network, designed for corporate use, and tailored to meet the organization's security standards. This deployment scenario ensures that the devices remain within the company's secure network environment.

The manufacturing facility restricts internet access, as the organization prioritizes data privacy and internal resource utilization. However, the internal network allows seamless access to critical manufacturing systems, production data, and real-time analytics. This network configuration empowers workers to make data-driven decisions and improve productivity on the shop floor.

The deployment incorporates Microsoft Entra join with MDM Auto Enrollment, managed through an MDM solution like Intune. Workers sign in using their corporate accounts through Microsoft Entra ID, granting them access to personalized resources and applications relevant to their roles.

The corporate network deployment supports both single and multiple users per device, which accommodates various manufacturing scenarios. For instance, technicians can use HoloLens 2 devices to access detailed equipment manuals, view 3D models for maintenance purposes, or receive remote assistance from experts.

To ensure device security and compliance, the deployment applies device lockdown configurations tailored to specific use cases. For example, in sensitive production areas, the devices might be set to a single app kiosk mode to limit access to only approved applications and prevent unauthorized modifications.

Overall, the corporate network deployment strategy enhances manufacturing operations by seamlessly integrating HoloLens 2 devices with the company's internal network. It allows workers to access critical resources, collaborate effectively, and use the power of mixed reality in a secure and controlled environment. This deployment scenario results in improved productivity, streamlined processes, and enhanced quality control throughout the manufacturing operations.
