Imagine a company specializing in field services, where technicians are dispatched to various locations to perform maintenance and repairs. To enhance their efficiency and effectiveness, the company decides to deploy HoloLens 2 devices to their technicians.

In this scenario, a cloud connected deployment strategy for HoloLens 2 would be highly appropriate. The technicians operate primarily in external environments, such as customer sites or remote locations, which are separate from the corporate network. They require access to real-time data, technical documentation, and remote assistance to troubleshoot complex issues.

The deployment starts with a pilot phase, where a single HoloLens 2 device is connected to the cloud to test the deployment process. The device is connected to cloud services and the public internet, allowing technicians to use advanced features like spatial mapping, object recognition, and remote collaboration tools.

Wi-Fi networks at customer sites or remote locations provide internet access, which allows seamless connectivity to cloud services. Microsoft Entra join with MDM Auto Enrollment, managed through Intune, ensures secure device management and user authentication. Technicians sign in using their corporate accounts through Microsoft Entra ID, which allows personalized access to relevant resources.

This cloud connected deployment supports both single and multiple users per device, accommodating various field service scenarios. Technicians can collaborate in real-time, accessing shared data, receiving guidance from experts, and capturing on-site information for analysis.

As the deployment expands, the company harnesses the power of the cloud to store and share holographic content, enabling knowledge sharing and standardized procedures across the field service team.

Overall, the cloud connected deployment strategy optimizes the field service operations by using the HoloLens 2 capabilities and cloud services. It enhances technician productivity, reduces downtime, and fosters effective collaboration, which ultimately improves customer satisfaction and streamlines maintenance and repair processes.
