Azure offers an unmatched variety of public, private, and hybrid cloud deployment models to address each customer’s concerns regarding the control of their data.

The underlying cloud platform that makes this solution possible is the Azure public multitenant cloud. Customers can augment Azure with on-premises and edge products such as Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge. These products support critical workloads over which customers seek increased or exclusive operational control. For example, Azure Stack Hub is intended for on-premises deployment in a customer-owned datacenter where the customer has full control over service connectivity. Moreover, Azure Stack Hub can be deployed to address tactical edge deployments for limited or no connectivity, including fully mobile scenarios.
