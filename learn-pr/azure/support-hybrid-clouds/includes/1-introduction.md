[Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/) portfolio is an extension of Azure that enables customers to build hybrid applications and run them consistently across on-premises, edge locations, and cloud. Azure Stack includes Azure Stack Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI), Azure Stack Hub, and Azure Stack Edge. The last two components (Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge) are discussed in this module.

Azure Stack Hub and Azure Stack Edge represent key enabling technologies that allow customers to process highly sensitive data using a private or hybrid cloud. These technologies also allow customers to pursue digital transformation using Microsoft's [intelligent cloud and intelligent edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/future-of-cloud/) approach. For many government customers the primary driving factors behind these efforts are enforcing data sovereignty, addressing custom compliance requirements, and applying maximum available protection to highly sensitive data. Government customers can use these products to exercise full operational control over their environment and even operate in a fully disconnected mode. As part of a cloud solution, they provide flexibility to support multiple data classifications under various conditions.
