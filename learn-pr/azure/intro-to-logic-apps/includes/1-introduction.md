When you have to implement a business process, you might find this work challenging because you typically need to make diverse services work together. Think about everything that your company uses to store and process data, for example, Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Oracle, X, YouTube, Dropbox, Google services, Azure AI services, and so on. How do you integrate all these products? Azure Logic Apps gives you prebuilt connectors that connect to 1000+ services and operations that perform various tasks. You use a graphical designer to put all the components together in any combination that you need. Then, Azure Logic Apps runs your process in the cloud, based on your specifications.

Suppose you work at an athletic shoe company that is launching a new product. You sell the shoes on your website, manage your cloud-hosted advertising videos, and monitor social media to gauge reactions to the launch. In the following illustration that shows these processes, notice how the tasks include both customer-facing processes such as direct sales, and administrative tasks such as autoarchiving old videos.

The first business process includes a typical flow for online sales, including receiving a customer order, charging a credit card, and shipping the product. The second process shows the company monitoring and analyzing social media postings about their products. The third process shows management of video assets by moving them to lower-cost storage as they get outdated.
