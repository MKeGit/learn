Azure dedicated hosts allow you to provision and manage physical servers within our data centers that are dedicated to your Azure subscription. Customers use this service to ensure that their VMs are hosted on private, dedicated hardware instead of shared, "multi-tenant" hardware. Let's take a look at the purpose, benefits and capabilities of this feature set.

Customers can choose from a range of host SKUs with varying levels of processing power, memory, and storage to meet their specific requirements. Compared to standard multi-tenant VM instances, dedicated hosts give you exclusive access to a host. You'll have control over the underlying infrastructure of VMs and can ensure that they're isolated from other tenants who would otherwise be running on the same physical hardware. This service is useful for customers who have specific compliance requirements or who need to run applications that require substantial system resources.

You can still use most of Azure's features that are used with standard VMs. Licensing and cost-saving features such as Azure Hybrid Benefit also apply to dedicated host VMs. Features such as activity logs, tags, templates, storage, and more are all available with dedicated hosts. The benefits of the Azure platform remain available to you with the addition of more control over your infrastructure. This ensures a seamless and cost-effective experience for businesses using dedicated hosts.
