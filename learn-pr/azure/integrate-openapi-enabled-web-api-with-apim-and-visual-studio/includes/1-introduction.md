[Azure API Management][az apim] helps organizations publish web APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. But before publishing the web APIs for other developers to consume, the author of the web APIs must first deploy them to Azure API Management.

Developers using Visual Studio to create ASP.NET Core web APIs can use functionality built right in to export their web API directly to Azure API Management.

In a previous module on fusion development teams, you met the folks at VanArsdel, Ltd. A fusion development team pairs professional, high-code, developers with citizen, low-code, developers to create better apps, faster. The citizen developers create applications to suit their exact needs using Power Apps and those applications consume services created by professional developers, such as web APIs. Before citizen developers can use any web APIs in their Power Apps applications, the web APIs must be hosted somewhere, and Azure API Management is an ideal spot.

The professional development team at VanArsdel, led by Kiana, have built several ASP.NET Core web APIs for inventory management. They want to publish the web APIs to [Azure App Service][az appsvc] and  [Azure API Management][az apim] using Visual Studio. This step allows the development teams to have minimal context switching between Azure API Management and Visual Studio during development.

Throughout this module, you explore how Visual Studio can offer frictionless development experiences for web API application development from code to deploy.
