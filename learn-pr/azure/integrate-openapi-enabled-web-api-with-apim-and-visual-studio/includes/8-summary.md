While developing a web API application, it's important that developers keep their productivity without having to context switch. Writing the application in Visual Studio and deploying it to Azure via a different tool may hurt a developer's productivity and the inner dev loop.

Visual Studio offers built-in features for seamless development experiences. Developers can publish an ASP.NET Core Web API application to Azure App Service. They can also integrate it with Azure API Management.

Therefore, with these features, developers can deploy an ASP.NET Core Web API app to Azure App Service without needing to leave Visual Studio. Additionally, they can integrate the Web API with Azure API Management without needing to leave Visual Studio.

In this module, you learned how to:

* Activate the OpenAPI feature on an ASP.NET Core Web API.
* Publish the Web API app to Azure App Service through Visual Studio.
* Integrate the Web API app with Azure API Management through Visual Studio.
* Verify the API through Azure API Management on Azure portal.
