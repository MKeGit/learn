While developing a web API application, it's important that developers keep their productivity without having to context switch. Writing the application in Visual Studio and deploying it to Azure via a different tool may hurt a developer's productivity and the inner dev loop.

Visual Studio offers built-in features for seamless development experiences:

* Publishing an ASP.NET Core Web API application to Azure App Service, and
* Integrating it with Azure API Management.

Therefore, with these features, developers can:

* Deploy an ASP.NET Core Web API app to Azure App Service without needing to leave Visual Studio, and
* Integrate the Web API with Azure API Management without needing to leave Visual Studio.

In this module, you learned how to:

* Activate the OpenAPI feature on an ASP.NET Core Web API.
* Publish the Web API app to Azure App Service through Visual Studio.
* Integrate the Web API app with Azure API Management through Visual Studio.
* Verify the API through Azure API Management on Azure portal.
