A successful cloud adoption requires a well-designed security strategy. Evaluate your cloud expertise and focus on cloud security, especially if you're transitioning from on-premises environments. To manage security in the cloud, you might need to restructure your security team and approach.

Organizational changes can cause stress and conflict. Ensure that management supports and clearly communicates these changes to all teams.

## Address common challenges

**Evolve your mindset.** Cloud security requires organization-wide participation and a broader scope than on-premises security. Every resource in the cloud is a potential attack vector, so you need an adapted security approach.

**Adjust teams and roles.** Cloud security involves specialized roles. You might need to add or reorganize teams to avoid security management gaps.

Recommendations:

- **Engage stakeholders in security discussions** early in the cloud adoption process to ensure organizational alignment.

- **Review the Cloud Adoption Framework** for guidance about implementing end-to-end security, including security teams, roles, and functions.
- **Embrace the Cloud Adoption Framework Secure methodology.** Apply Microsoft security best practices at each stage of cloud adoption, including security posture modernization, incident response, and the CIA Triad.
