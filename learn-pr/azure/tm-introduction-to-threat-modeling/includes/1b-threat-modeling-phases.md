Threat modeling is a technique used by anyone who knows how their system works and has a working knowledge of information security.

The technique is broken down into four different phases. Each phase contains important steps to help you create a data-flow diagram and analyze it for potential threats.

|Phase|Title|Description|
|-----|-----|-----------|
|1|Design|Capture all requirements for your system and create a data-flow diagram.|
|2|Break|Apply a threat-modeling framework to the data-flow diagram and find potential security issues.|
|3|Fix|Decide how to approach each issue with the right combination of security controls.|
|4|Verify|Verify requirements are met, issues are found, and security controls are implemented.|

This module discusses each phase in the next units.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The units in this module introduce important threat-modeling concepts at a high level. The Threat Modeling Fundamentals learning path discusses the concepts in detail.
