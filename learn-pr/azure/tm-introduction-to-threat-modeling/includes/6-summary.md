Threat modeling is an effective way to help secure your systems, applications, networks, and services. It identifies potential threats and recommends risk-reduction strategies to help you meet security goals early in the development lifecycle.

In this module, you:

- Understood the importance of capturing requirements and assumptions to help create a data-flow diagram
- Read about the framework that helps you find security issues in a system
- Learned about the security control categories that help you reduce or eliminate potential threats
- Highlighted the importance of verifying assumptions, requirements, and fixes before deployment

## What's next

In the next few modules of this learning path, learn about each concept introduced in the four phases in detail:

|Module|Title|Description|
|------|-----|-----------|
|2|Create a threat model using data-flow diagram elements|Learn about each element in a data-flow diagram, including when to use them and what context to include|
|3|Provide context with the right depth layer|Learn the differences between each context-depth layer and when to use them before you create a data-flow diagram|
|4|Approach your data-flow diagram with the right threat model focus|Learn about the different ways to focus your threat-modeling activities|
|5|Use a framework to identify threats and find ways to reduce or eliminate risk|Deep-dive into STRIDE and learn more about what's at risk and how to protect your system|
|6|Prioritize your issues and apply security controls|Learn to prioritize threats and understand the different types and functions of security controls for your system|
|7|Use recommended tools to create a data-flow diagram|Check out some of the tools you can use for threat modeling|
