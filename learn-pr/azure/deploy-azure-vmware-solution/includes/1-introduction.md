Imagine you work for a healthcare company that runs production workloads on a VMware platform. IT operations are spread among different offices. Several trends have surfaced in recent months:

- Some locations have equipment nearing end of life, so hardware-refresh decisions need to be made soon.
- Your company isn't able to get new infrastructure quickly enough to meet requests for hardware refreshes and new applications. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take four to six months or longer.

Your company has decided to migrate existing VMware workloads to Azure VMware Solution. Azure VMware Solution provides you with vSphere clusters built from dedicated, bare-metal Azure infrastructure. By using Azure VMware Solution, your company doesn't have to change virtualization platforms or alter existing operational patterns.

In this module, you'll learn how to plan and deploy Azure VMware Solution and then connect it to your existing, on-premises VMware infrastructure.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Plan a successful Azure VMware Solution deployment.
- Connect to an on-premises VMware environment.
