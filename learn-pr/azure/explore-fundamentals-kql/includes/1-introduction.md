Kusto Query Language (KQL) is the query language several Microsoft products use, including Azure Data Explorer, Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric, Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender XDR, Azure Resource Graph, and Resource Manager. Querying data using KQL lets you gain insights about your IT, business, and security from large data sets you collect, in near real time. 

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll learn about what KQL does, how it works, and when to use it. You'll explore basic query types, learn about some of the services that use KQL, and run simple queries in these service environments.  

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to identify key features and query environments for using KQL.
