Congratulations! You learned about autoscaling for your Java applications on Azure.

## Summary of what you learned

In this module, you learned about:

- Creating a Sample Autoscale architecture with Azure Spring Apps.

- Investigating the sample scale rules.

- Triggering scale actions.

- Best practices for scaling Java applications on Azure.

## Clean up your Azure resources

In the preceding processes, you created Azure resources. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete the resource group by running the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell:

```azurecli
az group delete --name <your Resource Group Name> --yes
```

### Delete your log analytics workspace

When you delete your resource group, you soft delete your Azure Log Analytics workspace. When soft deleting an Azure Log Analytics workspace, it gets into a soft-delete state to allow its recovery, including data and connected agents, within 14 days. If you wish to rerun the setup script and re-create your resources, either create a new workspace with a new name or use the following command to permanently delete the old workspace:

```azurecli
az monitor log-analytics workspace delete --force true --resource-group <your Resource Group Name> --workspace-name <your log analytics workspace name>
```
