The goal of inclusive design practices is to recognize the barriers before we implement them; to create structures that support the function of human diversity. We can empower people with different disabilities and from varied backgrounds to use technology to advance their lives and the lives of others. By taking basic principles into account, we understand the connection between systems and users, generating a powerful cycle of inclusion.
