FinOps is an operational framework and cultural practice that maximizes the business value of cloud, enables timely data-driven decision making, and creates financial accountability through collaboration between engineering, finance, and business teams. In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, cloud services have become integral to business operations, but they can also be a significant source of expenses. FinOps serves as a structured approach to tackle this challenge by promoting an organizational and cultural shift that empowers organizations to derive maximum value from their cloud investments.

At its core, FinOps revolves around six principles, and empowers individuals and teams to take ownership of their cloud spending while fostering a culture of cross-functional cooperation. Key components of the FinOps framework include its principals, phases, maturity model, personas, domains, and capabilities.
