The goal of the module was to help you learn about the different data protection and disaster recovery features in Azure NetApp Files to understand what solutions best serve your needs. 

In this module, you learned the various data protection and disaster recovery features in Azure NetApp Files: 

- Snapshots
- Backups
- Cross-region replication 
- Cross-zone replication  

You learned how snapshots and backups work in Azure NetApp Files as disaster recovery options in Azure NetApp Files. 

Azure NetApp Files cross-region replication enables you to fail over your critical application if a region-wide outage or disaster happens.
