In this module, you learned about Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, a service that provides you with a scalable way to run applications on a set of virtual machines (VMs).

- As demand grows, the number of VMs running in the scale set increases.
- As demand decreases, the number of VMs running in the scale set decreases. 

Virtual Machine Scale Sets are ideal for scenarios that include compute workloads, big-data workloads, and container workloads.
