  The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure provides guidance for this security modernization journey by providing clarity on processes, best practices, models, and experiences. This guidance is based on [Zero Trust](https://aka.ms/zerotrust) principles and the lessons learned and real-world experiences of Microsoft's own security work. It's also based on work with organizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Open Group, and the [Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/).
