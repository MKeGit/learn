  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What's the purpose of Azure landing zones?
    choices:
    - content: Landing zones provide a starting point for selecting specific security configuration settings in your environment.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Landing zones ensure that when an application or workload lands on Azure, the requisite infrastructure is already in place.
    - content: Help with cloud adoption by creating better ways to organize resources by type alone.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Landing zones create better ways to organize resources not just by type but by organization, cost, and security.
    - content: Evaluate relative risk scores of user accounts and devices, sensitivity of data, and key security isolation boundaries to actively defend.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Landing zones don't evaluate risk scores but provide cloud adoption teams with a well-managed environment for their workloads.
    - content: Help organizations meet the dual goals of enabling productivity and providing security assurances.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Security architects do this as part of their job. Landing zones are tools that security architects might use as part of those efforts.
