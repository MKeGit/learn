Security is a complex discipline that affects all aspects of your cloud and technology environments. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in people, processes, and technologies. Implement a coordinated approach across business, technology, and security teams. Each [team](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/teams-roles) must contribute to security efforts and collaborate effectively.

This Cloud Adoption Framework Secure guidance is one component of a larger holistic set of Microsoft security guidance designed to help various teams understand and perform their security responsibilities. The complete set includes the following guidance:

- **[The Cloud Adoption Framework Secure methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/overview)** provides security guidance for teams that manage the technology infrastructure that supports all the workload development and operations hosted on Azure.

- **[The Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/security/)** provides security best practices for application development and DevOps and DevSecOps processes.

- **[The Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/)** provides best practice guidance for stakeholders, including security baselines that describe the available security features and recommended optimal configurations for Azure services.
- **[Zero Trust guidance](/security/zero-trust/)** provides guidance for security teams to implement technical capabilities to support a Zero Trust modernization initiative.

## Security posture modernization

Enhance your security posture through the [Microsoft Zero Trust adoption framework](/security/zero-trust/adopt/zero-trust-adoption-overview). This framework provides a detailed, step-by-step approach to modernize your security posture. Follow the recommendations for each phase of the Cloud Adoption Framework methodology.

## Incident preparation and response

Incident preparation and response are essential for a strong security posture. Well-designed preparation mechanisms enable quicker threat detection and minimize the blast radius of incidents. Well-structured response mechanisms ensure efficient recovery and continuous improvement.

## The CIA triad

The CIA Triad represents three core principles in information security:

- **Confidentiality** protects sensitive information with encryption and access controls.
- **Integrity** maintains data accuracy and completeness. It protects data from unauthorized alterations.
- **Availability** ensures continuous access to information and resources for authorized users.

Adopt the CIA triad to ensure that your business technology remains reliable and secure. Use it to enforce reliability and security in your operations through well-defined, strictly followed, and proven practices.

## Security posture sustainment

Cyber threats continuously evolve, so continuous improvement helps maintain a robust security posture in the cloud. Use the guidance in this module to identify opportunities for ongoing enhancements.

Integrate security into every phase of your cloud adoption journey, collaborate effectively across teams, and continuously improve your security posture to protect against evolving threats.
