Your research projects typically start with a big-picture overview. You already know that datacenters are the main physical building blocks that enable the Microsoft Cloud, its services, and partner offerings.

What are these different types of cloud services running in datacenters? There are three general types available:

- Software as a service (SaaS), which allows users to connect to and use cloud-based applications over the internet. SaaS applications are also known as _hosted applications_. In general, users install no software; users sign in via a browser and use the hosted software. 

- Platform as a service (PaaS), a complete environment for development and deployment in the cloud. Resources enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. Purchase the resources you need from a [cloud service provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/) on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure internet connection.

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), a type of cloud computing service that offers compute, storage, and networking resources on demand. IaaS offerings enable organizations to remove the cost and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and datacenter infrastructure. Organizations pay for each resource for as long as they need it, on a pay-as-you-go basis. A [cloud computing service provider](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/choosing-a-cloud-service-provider/) like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/azure-iaas/) manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software - including operating systems, middleware, and applications.
