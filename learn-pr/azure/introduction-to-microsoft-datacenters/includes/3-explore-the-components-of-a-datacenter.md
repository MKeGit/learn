Contoso operates datacenters around the world. You understand the investment required and difficulties inherent in creating and operating datacenters. Microsoft Cloud services remove a portion of this burden by implementing key aspects of datacenters for you. These aspects include:

- The physical building that houses the computing infrastructure.

- Physical perimeter security and personnel security.

- The physical infrastructure components:

  - Server hardware offered in various types and sizes, including Intel and AMD CPUs and NVIDIA GPU hardware. Microsoft provides a range of pricing options and technical capabilities. From small virtual machines for development and test, to large VMs with 960 CPU threads, 24 TB of RAM, and up to 200 TB of blob storage with less than 1-ms latency.

  - Storage types, including hard disk drives, solid state and NVME (Non-Volatile Memory Express) drives, and drives and solutions from partners like NetApp.
  
  - High-speed networking within and between datacenters across the globe (covered in the Networking unit). 
  
  - Heating and cooling systems, and sustainability management initiatives. Microsoft has the most aggressive sustainability efforts in the industry. It experiments with new ways to lower the carbon footprint of its datacenters through innovations like [liquid immersion](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/datacenter-liquid-cooling/) of servers, submerging datacenters underseas, and using wind and solar power.
  
- Sophisticated backup systems that include always-on UPS battery systems and backup power generators, which ensure smooth power transitions during a grid power outage.

In addition, Microsoft is committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030, which is an aggressive carbon goal that you can make use of for Contoso's sustainability efforts.

## Datacenter viability

Microsoft selects datacenter locations based on a set of long-term viability criteria. These include customer demand; proximity to population centers; an ample, reliable, and stable power source; multiple high-capacity network connections; a large pool of skilled labor; a weather and disaster profile; and sustainable and affordable energy. The selection process improves application and data availability by sharing downtime risk across other datacenters.
