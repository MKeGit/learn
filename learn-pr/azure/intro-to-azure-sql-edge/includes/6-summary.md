Our goal was to help you decide if Azure SQL Edge is a good choice for your organization. To help guide your decision, you used the following criteria:

- Connectivity and broadband limitations.
- Latency.
- Data security, privacy, and ownership.
- Synchronization with, and connectivity to, back-end systems.
- Familiarity.

You applied these criteria to your fictional organization, in which your developers are creating and deploying IoT apps that can collect, mine, and analyze data from the edge. Azure SQL Edge is a relational database engine that uses the same codebase as Microsoft SQL Server. It's optimized for IoT and IoT Edge. As such, it provides the same security as Microsoft SQL Server. It also offers a familiar experience for your developers and the same tool interfaces they're likely familiar.

These criteria helped you decide that Azure SQL Edge is appropriate for interaction with your apps and IoT devices at the edge. You also learned how Azure SQL Edge's familiar engine and toolset features could help you optimize data ingest and analysis. You learned that Azure SQL Edge is:

- Powerful enough to support edge compute.
- Secure enough to help meet privacy needs of IoT applications.
- Compatible with a familiar ecosystem of products, tools, and services.

You should now be able to determine how Azure SQL Edge and its familiar features can help you support the full range of IoT scenarios.
