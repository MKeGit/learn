Suppose you're a developer who works on a team that creates narrated videos for your company's marketing department. Your company usually hires vocal talent to read your video scripts, but the overtime from multiple vocal takes can be expensive, and coordinating the recording sessions for your vocal talent and studio resources requires a great deal of scheduling.

You've heard that Microsoft's Azure AI services provide developers with APIs to create applications that take advantage of Azure's text to speech features, and your manager has asked you to research how you can use Azure AI services' text to speech features to create an application you can use to create narration while your videos are in progress, thereby alleviating some of your operating costs and scheduling issues.

In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure AI services to create a text to speech application that uses both plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to create audio files.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Create an Azure AI services account
- Create a command-line application that converts text to an audio file.
- Create a command-line application that converts SSML to an audio file.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with development tools
