You can deploy a private mobile network by using one of these three methods:

- **Azure portal** - Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/signin/index/) to deploy a private mobile network to match your enterprise's requirements.

- **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates** - An [ARM template](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your deployment. The template uses declarative syntax. In declarative syntax, you describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.

   For more information on using ARM templates for deployment, see [Deploy a private mobile network and site - ARM template - Azure Private 5G Core Preview](/azure/private-5g-core/deploy-private-mobile-network-with-site-arm-template).

- **Azure REST APIs** - This method is best suited for advanced system integrators and solution developers.
