This section describes how to use the Azure portal and ARM templates to design and deploy a private mobile network as part of a private multi-access edge compute (MEC) solution on an enterprise edge.

Deploying a private mobile network using Azure Private 5G Core at the enterprise edge ensures complete ownership of all data by the enterprise. It also positions the packet core instance as close as possible to the devices it serves, removing any reliance on cloud connectivity. This configuration lets it deliver low latency levels through local data processing when combined with application logic in the same location.

The Azure Private 5G Core solution is made up of the Azure Stack Edge (ASE) compute platform and the Azure Private 5G Core software, which work together with management functions in the Azure cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> The cloud components of Azure Private 5G Core can be deployed in the US East, North Europe, and West Europe Azure regions.  

Before you deploy a private mobile network, you should carefully consider your enterprise's needs. For information on designing private mobile networks, see [Private Mobile Network Design Requirements](/azure/private-5g-core/private-mobile-network-design-requirements).
