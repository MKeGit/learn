Azure DNS lets you host your DNS records for your domains on Azure infrastructure. With Azure DNS, you can use the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

Let's say that your company recently bought the custom domain name wideworldimporters.com from a third-party domain-name registrar. The domain name is for a new website that your organization plans to launch. You need a hosting service for DNS domains. This hosting service would resolve the wideworldimporters.com domain to your web server's IP address.

You're already using Azure to build your website, so you decide to use Azure DNS to manage your domain.

This module shows you how to configure Azure DNS to host your domain. You'll also see how to add an alias and other DNS records to resolve your domain name to a website.
