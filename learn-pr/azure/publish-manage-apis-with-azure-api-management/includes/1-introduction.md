Azure API Management acts as a gateway between your web APIs and the public internet.

Suppose you're the lead developer for an online shoe company. The company is growing quickly and wants to optimize its supply chain. One component of this optimization is to expose some internal data and processes, such as inventory and planning, to partners so they can directly access information on current stock levels. You want to provide partner access through a set of web APIs. When these APIs are published on the public internet, only partner applications should be able to use them. Your company and your partners want to minimize the costs of integration, and your developer teams want to focus on the business logic, not secondary concerns such as authorization.

In this module, you create an API gateway to securely publish an API. To introduce ways you can secure access to an API, you use an API Management subscription key. At the end of this module, you're able to use API Management to publish any API.
