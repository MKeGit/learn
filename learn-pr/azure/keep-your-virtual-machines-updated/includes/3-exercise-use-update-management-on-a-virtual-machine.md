Your Public Information Officer (PIO) wants to set up a virtual machine to serve as a web resource for local media outlets. It's imperative that this virtual machine (VM) is as protected as it can be to prevent unauthorized access. As part of your security profile, you want to implement Update Management on this VM so that you can ensure that it's always up to date with the latest security patches.
