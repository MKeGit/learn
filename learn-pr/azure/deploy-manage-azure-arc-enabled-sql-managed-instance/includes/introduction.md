An Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance offers a managed, scalable, and resilient deployment of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine in a wide range of hybrid scenarios.

### Example scenario

Suppose you work for a New York-based financial services company with a global customer base and several US government contracts. Your on-premises environment contains several SQL Server databases hosted in overseas datacenters that are subject to data residency requirements. It also includes the US government contract-related data that need to be fully isolated from the internet. For cloud-based data services, you rely on Azure SQL. These services include several deployments of Azure SQL Managed Instance.

As the lead of the IT infrastructure engineering team, you help solution architects, data engineers, and software developers modernize internal and public-facing services and applications. Your recent efforts led to your company adopting Kubernetes as the internal standard for container orchestration. Following the directives from the company’s technology leadership, you’re also exploring opportunities to reduce administrative overhead, streamline the operational model, and increase the resiliency of business-critical workloads.

You need a solution that helps you reach all of these objectives and apply the existing investment into Kubernetes. So you decide to try using an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance for hosting the remaining on-premises SQL Server databases.
