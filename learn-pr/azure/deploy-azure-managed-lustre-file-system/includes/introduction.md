Azure Managed Lustre is a managed, pay-as-you-go file system for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI workloads. It's a purpose-built managed service that simplifies operations, reduces setup costs, and eliminates complex maintenance. Lustre is an open-source parallel file system that can scale to massive storage sizes while also providing high performance throughput. Azure Managed Lustre provides the high-performance storage of Lustre with the control and consistency of Microsoftâ€™s cloud.

Suppose you're a systems administrator at a research institution. The institution is conducting research that requires high-performance computing to analyze large volumes of weather and climate data to build prediction models. You're looking for ways to simplify the setup and maintenance of your storage infrastructure to manage costs for the organization, and to enable the researchers to focus on their work. With Azure Managed Lustre, you can deploy high-performance file systems on demand without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure. Additionally, you can manage costs by integrating the file system with Azure Blob Storage, which provides a cost-effective long-term storage solution when the workload processing is complete.

In this module, you learn how to create an Azure Managed Lustre file system, integrate the file system with Blob Storage, and access the file system from clients for workload processing. You also learn how to export the file system data to a blob container for long-term storage when the processing is complete.

## Learning objectives
