Suppose you work for a large B2B consumer goods company. You want to provide your employees with a self-service way to use, discover, and build insights from data scattered across the operational systems in your business. Including your numerous legacy systems that contain data that is still rich with opportunity. Your job is to make sure you're surfacing this data, and the data from all systems, in a way that abstracts away the complexity and promotes the open and creative use of this data. Both to solve day to day and long-term strategic pieces of the company goals and KPIs.

In this module, you create and deploy a data technology stack that consists of:  

- ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2
- Microsoft Purview
- CluedIn
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Key Vault

This stack allows you to share high quality data for driving downstream systems with data that's ready to generate insights.

By the end of this module, you're able to build a recommended data management landing zone. As described in the Azure Common Fundamentals Framework, this landing zone encapsulates data governance, master data management, data quality, and data integration.
