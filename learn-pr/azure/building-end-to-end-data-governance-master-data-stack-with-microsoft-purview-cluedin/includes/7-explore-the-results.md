With your data now mapped into the CluedIn platform and streaming to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 2, let's explore the data in the CluedIn Studio.

1. In the search bar at the top of the Studio, search for **Lorain**. CluedIn provides some autosuggested search results, but you can select the search button or press enter to see the results.

1. If you mapped the data like in the previous exercise then you should see one result for Lorain. If you see more than one, revisit the last part of the exercise as you might be missing a mapped identifier. Most importantly, we don't see three Lorain records from across the three input files, but rather one single record of Lorain.

1. Select the result to be taken through the **Single View** of Lorain.

1. Here are the inbuilt data quality metrics of CluedIn. Don't be alarmed if some of the quality metrics don't have a value yet. The values either come over time or you might need to set up other parts of the platform for them to be enabled. You should, however see that we're starting to get scores for Data Accuracy, Data Completeness, and more.

1. Navigate to the **All Properties** tab and you see all of the data for Lorain, including the fact that we don't have columns for *first*, *fname*, and *first_name*. Instead, we have one normalized key, with the values from each of the respective input columns as values.

1. For any of the properties such as *employee.Email*, select the ellipsis button, to reveal a submenu with an option to **View History**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Here you have the three different emails of Lorain, more proof that we could not have used this to stitch together the three records.

1. Now select the **Relations** tab. There's one single record for Lorain, however there's a relationship that is built to a company.

    >[!NOTE]
    > What is interesting here is that at no point in the mapping process did you tell CluedIn how to integrate the data, but rather you made a reference that the person_id column should refer to an Employee. Which file that Employee came from was not something that we specified.

1. Select the **History** tab to reveal that we have 4 entries. Unsuprisingly, we have the entries from the three files from Xero, Salesforce, and Experian. However, there's another entry in here generated by the CluedIn system that didn't come from a file.

    This entry is what CluedIn calls a *Shadow Entity*. In the mapping process, you uploaded the file called **Companies.csv** first. In that file, there was a reference to a Person/Employee with the column of person_id. When you processed this data into CluedIn, the system created a Shadow Entity called a *placeholder*, for a Person/Employee that might not actually enter the system at all.

1. Finally, select the **Topology** tab where a visual is provided of the logic CluedIn used to stitch Lorain's record together from the three files. Unsuprisingly, it never used the email address field, but it did triangulate the ID and the PersonId from the three files to form one record.
