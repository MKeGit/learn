When deciding on a distribution strategy for your HoloLens 2 application, it's essential to ask yourself a series of questions to ensure you make an informed decision. Here are 10 key questions that developers should consider:

- **Who is my target audience?** Understanding your target audience's preferences, behavior, and accessibility is crucial in selecting the most effective distribution strategy.
- **What are my app's goals and objectives?** Clarify the purpose of your application and identify the desired outcomes to align your distribution strategy accordingly.
- **What is my app's scope?** Determine if your app caters to a niche market, a specific industry, or if it has broader appeal; this decision influences the choice of distribution channels.
- **What level of control do I need over app distribution?** Assess whether you require full control over app deployment, updates, and monetization, or if you're open to using existing platforms and marketplaces.
- **How important is app discoverability?** Consider the visibility and discoverability your app might have on different distribution platforms, and evaluate how it aligns with your marketing and promotional efforts.
- **What monetization options are available?** Explore the monetization models that different distribution channels offer to determine which aligns best with your app's revenue strategy. Examples include paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, or ad revenue.
- **What are the technical requirements and limitations of each distribution option?** Understand the technical considerations, such as file formats, compatibility, and restrictions imposed by different distribution methods to ensure your app meets the necessary criteria.
- **Do I require enterprise deployment capabilities?** Determine if your app needs to be distributed within closed enterprise environments, necessitating support for enterprise app stores or deployment tools.
- **What's the level of support and resources available for each distribution option?** Consider the level of support, documentation, and community resources the distribution channels provide, because this information can impact the ease of implementation and troubleshooting.
- **What are the long-term implications of my distribution strategy?** Consider the scalability, maintenance, and updates required for your chosen distribution method, and evaluate if they align with your long-term app development and management goals.

By reflecting on these questions, you can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions regarding your application's distribution strategy.
