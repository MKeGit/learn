Youâ€™re a mixed-reality developer who's been working tirelessly on creating a HoloLens application. After countless hours of coding, designing immersive experiences, and perfecting every detail, you find yourself at a crossroads, unsure of the best distribution choice for your HoloLens application. You begin to contemplate the various application distribution options available. Should you go the traditional route and release the application on the Microsoft Store? Or do you want more control over distribution and opt for sideloading?

For your HoloLens 2 application to reach its intended audience and make a meaningful impact, it's essential to understand the process of distribution. Distribution refers to the process of making an application available to users to download, install, and use on their devices. It involves packaging the application in a suitable format, choosing a distribution channel or method, and delivering the application to the intended audience. Distribution also encompasses managing updates to ensure users have access to the latest versions of the application.

In this module, we explore distribution options and considerations for HoloLens apps. By the end of this module, you should be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to effectively distribute your HoloLens 2 application, thus allowing users to experience the immersive and transformative capabilities of mixed reality.
