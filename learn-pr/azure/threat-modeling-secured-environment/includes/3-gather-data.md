To help you navigate the threat modeling process for an application to be used in a secured environment, we created a fictitious company, called Woodgrove Bank.

## Company background

Woodgrove Bank is an online banking provider established in 2018 that gives customers the ability to conduct financial transactions and bill payments online. With no physical locations, Woodgrove relies on an online portal and cross-platform applications for their daily operations. Customers can choose from free online transfers, high-interest yield savings accounts, and bill payment services. Transactions are secured using best-in-class encryption, and customer service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. With transparent fees, real-time status updates, and money back guarantee, Woodgrove has what it takes to gain your business.

Woodgrove Bank rolled out alternate identities and PAWs for the two IT administrators to work on their critical assets securely.

## Application background

Fourth Coffee is a standalone, free, and open-source password management client application used to store production resource credentials.

It serves as a local fallback to Azure Key Vault.

The IT admins would like to make sure there are no security issues before installing the application in the secured environment.

## Your task

You were recently brought in by Woodgrove Bank's senior leadership team to:

1. Identify the security risks of applications to be used in the secured environment.
2. Find ways to reduce or eliminate risk.

After you talked to the IT admins and researched the application, here's what you found out:
