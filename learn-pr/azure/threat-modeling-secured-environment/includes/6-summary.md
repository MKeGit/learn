Threat modeling an application before adding it to a secured environment helps you identify and secure potential risks as early as possible.

In this module, you:

- Understood the importance of a well defined, open-ended questionnaire to get a better view of the application.
- Visualized how the application interacts with the secured environment with a detailed data-flow diagram.
- Identified security gaps using the threat modeling framework.
- Reduced or eliminated risks with known security requirements and controls.
