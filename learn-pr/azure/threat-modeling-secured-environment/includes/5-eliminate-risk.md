|----|--------|
|Sensitive corporate data stored in client application|Enable disk encryption and use an application monitoring service to detect anomalies.|
|No security scans available|As part of your security assessment, run different [security tools](/azure/security/develop/security-code-analysis-overview) to help you identify security issues in code.|
|Outdated application version|Investigate the changes between the new version against the one proposed. Recommend the one with the least number of issues.|
|No backup, logging, or monitoring|Enable Azure Backup and Monitoring to prevent data loss. Visit the complete [list of services](/azure/security/fundamentals/end-to-end).|
|No 2FA enforcement|As part of the installation exercise, enable 2FA in the application.|
|No password requirements|You can't make changes to the password policy, but you can require users to save their main passwords in [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) to prevent accidental disclosure.|
|No vendor Service Level Agreement (SLA)|Develop a process to consistently check the application against potential threats that could put the PAW at risk.|
