A private mobile network contains several components, such as the packet core instance for each site or the user equipment (UE) attached to the network. Azure Private 5G Core allows you to centrally manage each of these components through the Azure portal by using the portal GUI or ARM templates.

From this unit, you learned the tools and methods for the following major management tasks:

- Managing a private mobile network and each site in it, including slicing a network or modifying a packet core instance.
- Using SIM policies and services to control the network traffic for UEs attached in a private mobile network.
- Managing the SIMs for UEs attached in a private mobile network.
- Upgrading the packet core instance for each site in a private mobile network.

Now, based on the business needs of your organization, you should be able to manage its private mobile network on a daily basis. For example, you should be able to configure new SIM policies for a new IoT application or upgrade the packet core instance for a site to a new version.
