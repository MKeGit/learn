In this unit, we'll look at logging concepts and commands. We'll run the commands in the next exercise.

## Types of Logging

With the sample application, there are two ways to see logs: **Log streaming** for real-time logs per application instance, or **Log Analytics** for aggregated logs with advanced query capability.
In this unit, we'll explore log streaming via the Azure CLI.

### Log streaming

Log streaming allows developers to get real-time application logs via the Azure CLI and know whatâ€™s happening with specified application instance in your Azure Spring Apps.

You can use log streaming in the Azure CLI via the Azure Shell with the following command:

```azurecli
az spring app logs --name <application> --resource-group <resource group name> --service <service instance name> -f
```

### Tail log for application with multiple instances

First, you can get the application instance names with following command:

```azurecli
az spring app logs -f --name customers-service
```

Your results should look similar to the following:

```output
Name                                         Status    DiscoveryStatus
Multiple app instances found:
customers-service-default-17-7bc5f9dd79-fshb9
customers-service-default-17-7bc5f9dd79-pf69h
Please use '-i/--instance' parameter to specify the instance name
```

If multiple instances exist for the application named `app`, you can view the instance log by using the `-i/--instance` option:

```azurecli
az spring app logs -f --name customers-service --instance customers-service-default-17-7bc5f9dd79-fshb9
```

You can also get details of application instances from the Azure portal. After selecting **Apps** in the left navigation pane of your Azure Spring Apps service, select **App Instances**.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `az spring app logs -h` to explore more parameters and log stream functionality.
