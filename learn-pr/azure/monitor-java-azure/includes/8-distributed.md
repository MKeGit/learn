In this unit, we look at monitoring the entire solution.

## Introduction

Enabling monitoring across today's complex computing environments requires collecting operational data from every layer and component of a distributed system. You need deep insights on this data, and to combine it with different perspectives to support the multitude of stakeholders in your organization.

Azure Monitor collects data from different kinds of sources, where you can use it for analysis, visualization, and alerting. It gives you deep insights across all your monitored resources and even with data from other services that store their data in Azure Monitor.

## Log analytics

Logs are events that occurred within the system. Logs can contain different kinds of data, and might be structured or free-form text with a timestamp. Logs might be created sporadically as events in the environment generate log entries. A system under heavy load typically generates more log volume.

Logs in Azure Monitor are valuable for identifying the root causes of issues. Data that Azure Monitor Logs collects is stored in one or more Log Analytics workspaces. Data is retrieved from a Log Analytics workspace using a log query, which is a read-only request to process data and return results. Log queries are written in **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**, which is the same query language Azure Data Explorer uses.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Azure Spring Apps sample application has already been set up with a Log Analytics workspace.
> For more information on **KQL** syntax, see the Summary unit at the end of this training.

### Use Log Analytics

There are actually three ways to access your application's logs: Azure Storage, Azure Events Hub, and Log Analytics. We'll focus here on Log Analytics because it's the most common one and is integrated into Azure Spring Apps for metrics monitoring.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Log data ingestion time in Azure Monitor can take up to 15 minutes. If data isn't found in Log Analytics, it might take additional time to ingest Azure Spring Apps log data.

1. Open the Azure portal.

1. Select **Azure Spring Apps** from the list of Azure services.

1. Select your Azure Spring Apps instance.

1. Next, under the **Monitoring** section, select **Logs**.

1. In the **Query** search box:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/8-cloud-logs.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing query for Azure Spring Apps logs." lightbox="../media/8-cloud-logs.jpg":::

   - To view logs, run a query such as:

     ```sql
     AppPlatformLogsforSpring
     | limit 50
     ```

   - To view metrics, enter a query such as:

     ```sql
     AzureMetrics
     | limit 50
     ```

   - You can search the logs of the specific application or instance by setting a filter condition:

     ```sql
     AppPlatformLogsforSpring
     | where ServiceName == "YourServiceName" and AppName == "YourAppName" and InstanceName == "YourInstanceName"
     | limit 50
     ```

### Analyze the Application logs

Application logs provide critical information and verbose logs about your application's health, performance, and more. In the next section, we provide queries to help you understand your application's current and past states.

### Show application logs from Azure Spring Apps

1. Open the Azure portal.

1. Select **Azure Spring Apps** from the list of Azure services.

1. Select your Azure Spring Apps instance.

1. Next, under the **Monitoring** section, select **Logs**.

1. In the **Query** search box:

   - To review a list of application logs from Azure Spring Apps, sorted by time with the most recent logs shown first, run the following query:

     ```sql
     AppPlatformLogsforSpring
     | project TimeGenerated , ServiceName , AppName , InstanceName , Log
     | sort by TimeGenerated desc
     ```

   - To review unsorted log entries that mention an error or exception, run the following query:

     ```sql
     AppPlatformLogsforSpring
     | project TimeGenerated , ServiceName , AppName , InstanceName , Log
     | where Log contains "error" or Log contains "exception"
     ```

   - To create a pie chart that displays the number of errors and exceptions logged by your application, run the following query:

       ```sql
       AppPlatformLogsforSpring
       | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
       | where Log contains "error" or Log contains "exception"
       | summarize count_per_app = count() by AppName
       | sort by count_per_app desc
       | render piechart
       ```

## Database Monitoring

Monitoring data about your servers helps you troubleshoot and optimize for your workload. Azure Database for MySQL provides various metrics that give insight into the behavior of your server.

In Azure Database for MySQL, the slow query log is available to users. Access to the transaction log isn't supported. You can use the slow query log to identify performance bottlenecks for troubleshooting.

In our sample application, your slow query logs are set up to be piped to Azure Monitor Logs through Diagnostic Logs, and you can do further analysis of your slow queries. Following are sample queries to help you get started/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The MySQL Log data ingestion time in Azure Monitor can take up to 30 minutes. If data is not found in Log Analytics, it may take additional time to ingest MySQL log data.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

1. Select your Azure Database for MySQL server you use for your Azure Spring Apps.

1. Next, under the **Monitoring** section, select **Logs**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/8-mysql-logs.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing query for queries longer than one second." lightbox="../media/8-mysql-logs.jpg":::

1. In the **Query** search box:

   - To retrieve all Queries longer than one second, run the following query:

     ```sql
     AzureDiagnostics
     | where Category == 'MySqlSlowLogs'
     | project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, start_time_t , query_time_d, sql_text_s 
     ```

   - To list the top five longest queries, run the following query:

     ```sql
     AzureDiagnostics
     | where Category == 'MySqlSlowLogs'
     | project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, start_time_t , query_time_d, sql_text_s 
     | order by query_time_d desc
     | take 5
     ```

   - To summarize slow queries by minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation query time, run the following query:

     ```sql
     AzureDiagnostics
     | where Category == 'MySqlSlowLogs'
     | project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, start_time_t , query_time_d, sql_text_s 
     | summarize count(), min(query_time_d), max(query_time_d), avg(query_time_d), stdev(query_time_d), percentile(query_time_d, 95) by LogicalServerName_s
     ```

   - To graph the slow query distribution on a particular server, run the following query:

     ```sql
     AzureDiagnostics
     | where Category == 'MySqlSlowLogs'
     | project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, start_time_t , query_time_d, sql_text_s 
     | summarize count() by LogicalServerName_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
     | render timechart
     ```

1. You can also use the audit log to track database-level activity. It's commonly used for compliance. Audit logs are integrated with Azure Monitor Diagnostic Logs. In your sample, we've enabled audit logs on your MySQL server so you can do further analysis of your audited events.

   - Here's a sample query that retrieves the general MySQL log:

      ```sql
      AzureDiagnostics
      | where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs' and event_class_s == "general_log"
      | project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s 
      | order by TimeGenerated desc
      ```

## UI monitoring

If you add Application Insights to your page script, you get timings of page loads and AJAX calls, counts, and details of browser exceptions and AJAX failures, also users and session counts. You can segment all of these metrics by page, client OS and browser version, geo-location, and other dimensions. You can set alerts on failure counts or slow page loading, and byy inserting trace calls in your JavaScript code, you can track how the different features of your web page application are used.

You can use Application Insights with any web page; you just add a short piece of JavaScript. If your web service is Java, you can use the server-side SDKs with the client-side JavaScript SDK to get an understanding of your app's performance.
