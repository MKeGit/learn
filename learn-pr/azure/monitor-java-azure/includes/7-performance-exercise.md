In this exercise, with zero configuration, you'll effortlessly monitor data flows for your sample application.

## Monitor the Application with Azure Application Insights

Application Map helps you spot performance bottlenecks or failure hot spots across all components of your distributed application.

1. Open the Azure portal.
1. Select **Azure Spring Apps** from the list of Azure services.
1. Select your Azure Spring Apps instance.
4. Select **Application Insights** to go to the overview page of Application Insights.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/7-insights-start.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing Application insights for your Spring Apps." lightbox="../media/7-insights-start.jpg":::

1. On the left, navigate to **Application map**, where you can see a view of your Azure Spring Apps microservices:

The Application map shows applications that are operating correctly (green) and those applications with bottlenecks (red).

In the preceding Application map, each name in a green box is a different service of your Azure Spring Apps.

You can easily identify issues in your applications and quickly troubleshoot and fix them. Each node on the map represents a microservice or its dependencies, with health KPI and alerts status. You can select from any component to more detailed diagnostics, such as Application Insights events.

### Performance

1. On the left, navigate to **Performance**, where you can see response times and request counts for operations exposed by your applications.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-petclinic-microservices-performance.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing operation performance view for your Azure Spring Apps instance." lightbox="../media/4-petclinic-microservices-performance.jpg":::

1. Next, on the right, navigate to **Dependencies**, where you can see all your dependencies and their response times and request counts.

   You can see the performance number for dependencies, particularly SQL calls:

### Metrics

Spring Boot registers many core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback, and so on. You can see metrics contributed by Spring Boot apps, Spring Apps modules, and dependencies.

To create a standard metric chart, under the **Monitoring** section, open the **Metrics** tab and follow these steps:

1. Ensure your Azure Spring Apps is selected under **Scope** and **Azure Spring Apps** under **Metric Namespace**. Both will already be populated if you opened the metrics explorer from the resource's menu.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-metrics.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing metrics.":::

2. Next, under **Metrics**, select **App CPU Usage** and select **Avg** under **Aggregation**:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-metrics-cpu-first-add.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing adding app cpu metrics." lightbox="../media/4-metrics-cpu-first-add.jpg":::

3. Save the first metric by selecting the **Tick** icon on the right-hand metric bar.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-metrics-cpu-first.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing metrics selection." lightbox="../media/4-metrics-cpu-first.jpg":::

4. Next, add another metric by selecting the **Add metric** action on the top left-hand toolbar and add **system.cpu.usage** under **Metric** and **Avg** under **Aggregation**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-metrics-add-second.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing adding system cpu metrics." lightbox="../media/4-metrics-add-second.jpg":::

5. Next, save the second metric by selecting the **Tick** icon on the right-hand metric bar.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-metrics-add.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing saving system cpu metrics." lightbox="../media/4-metrics-add.jpg":::

6. Finally, inspect your metrics graph, showing both the App and System CPU metrics.

### Custom Metrics

As you deploy resources and applications in Azure, you'll want to start collecting telemetry to gain insights into their performance and health. Azure makes some metrics available to you out of the box. These metrics are called *standard* or *platform*. However, they're limited in nature.
You might want to collect some custom performance indicators or business-specific metrics to provide deeper insights.

Similarly to standard metric chart, to create a custom metric chart, open the **Metrics** tab under the **Monitoring** section and follow these steps:

1. Ensure your Azure Spring Apps is selected in the resource scope picker. It will already be populated if you opened metrics explorer from the resource's menu.

2. Next, under **Metric Namespace**, select the **azure.applicationinsights** namespace. The namespace is just a way to organize metrics so that you can easily find them.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/7-custom-namespace.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing namespace selection for custom metrics." lightbox="../media/7-custom-namespace.jpg":::

3. Next, under **Metrics**, add the following custom metrics and aggregation:

   - Metric `petclinic_pet`, Aggregation: `count`

     :::image type="content" source="../media/7-custom-metrics.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing metric and aggregate selection for custom metrics." lightbox="../media/7-custom-metrics.jpg":::

   - Metric `petclinic_owner`, Aggregation: `count`

   - Metric `petclinic_visit`, Aggregation: `count`

     :::image type="content" source="../media/7-custom-third.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing finished custom metrics view." lightbox="../media/7-custom-third.jpg":::

4. Next, on the top right-hand side, change the graph type to **Area Chart**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/7-custom-area.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing graph type selection for custom metrics view." lightbox="../media/7-custom-area.jpg":::

   Your final graph will show the counts in the last 24 hours for each of the pet, vet, and owner microservices:

   :::image type="content" source="../media/7-custom.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing final custom metrics view." lightbox="../media/7-custom.jpg":::

### Live Metrics

When you deploy a new version of your web app, you want to know immediately its effect on performance. Have response times improved or worsened, or is it showing failures? When you watch Live Metrics Stream in Application Insights while your deployment is happening, youâ€™ll see the effect immediately. If there are problems, you could back out the deployment before too many users are affected.

Live Metrics Stream allows you to probe the beating heart of your live applications. You can select and filter metrics and performance counters to watch in real time without any disturbance to your service. You can also inspect stack traces from sample failed requests and exceptions.

1. On the left, under **Investigate**, navigate to **Live metrics**, where you can see live metrics practically in real time (within only one second):

   :::image type="content" source="../media/4-petclinic-microservices-live-metrics.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot showing live metrics view for your Azure Spring Apps." lightbox="../media/4-petclinic-microservices-live-metrics.jpg":::

2. Scroll down the metrics to see the metrics for each microservice:
