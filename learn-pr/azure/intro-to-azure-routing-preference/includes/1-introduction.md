Routing preference in Azure controls how traffic flows from Azure to the public internet. With routing preference, data transfer traffic is routed over the Microsoft global network or over the public internet.

## Example scenario

You're a network engineer for a multinational car manufacturer. The factory application developers deployed an application in the Central US Azure region. This application is used by one of the company's factories in Singapore. Recently, the cost of traffic from the Singapore factory to the Central US region across the Microsoft backbone network increased. You're tasked with creating a plan to alleviate some of the cost of the network traffic from Singapore to the application in Azure.

After completing this module, you'll know more about routing preference and how determining the routing affects the data transfer costs in your Azure subscription.

## What are we doing?

In this module, you learn about how routing from Azure to the public internet works by default. You learn about routing preference and how you can change how traffic is transferred between the Azure and the internet. You explore scenarios where it might be appropriate to change how data is transferred between Azure and the internet. Finally, we discuss routing preference unmetered and how it differs from routing preference.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you should be able to decide whether routing preference is a good choice for savings in your data transfer costs.
