    choices:
    - content: Implement a governance foundation in Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Implementing governance through Azure is one of the coolest tech accomplishments, but it doesn't show much value beyond the hands-on team that creates it.
    - content: Update the existing corporate policy to outline concerns, risks, triggers, and actions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Corporate policy is important, but few see the value of this exercise initially.
    - content: Deploy cost management controls and processes.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Although important, cost management doesn't help with the security concerns.
    - content: Deploy security baseline controls and processes.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! In the customer narrative, the visible pain points can be addressed through an automated security baseline to reduce security risks.
  - content: Which step increases confidence for the CIO?
    choices:
    - content: Implement a governance foundation in Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Implementing governance through Azure is one of the coolest tech accomplishments, but it doesn't show much value beyond the hands-on team that creates it.
    - content: Update the existing corporate policy to outline concerns, risks, triggers, and actions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Corporate policy is important, but these aspects of governance don't address the concerns the CIO raises in the customer narrative.
    - content: Deploy cost management controls and processes.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! In this narrative, the CIO expresses concerns with cost. Addressing those concerns by adding cost management controls builds confidence.
    - content: Deploy security baseline controls and processes.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The CIO added cost risks and concerns to the list, and the existing policy had nothing to do with cost. It's also a message that the CIO shares throughout the narrative.
