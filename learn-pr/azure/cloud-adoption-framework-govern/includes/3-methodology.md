To implement proper cloud governance, you need proper business policy, protective guardrails, and skilled people taking a consistent, disciplined approach to governance.

## Build governance maturity

Adhere to the following steps to build a mature cloud-governance solution:

1. **Understand the methodology**: Understand the underlying methodology.

1. **Determine your governance benchmark**: Assess your current-state and future-state needs.
1. **Establish your governance foundation**: Use governance tools to establish your governance foundation.
1. **Make continuous improvements**: Iteratively add governance controls to address risks.

Use these steps to get started with the Govern methodology in the cloud, and follow a path to mature governance security when your cloud adoption plan progresses.

## Use the Govern methodology

The Govern methodology provides a structured approach that you can use to establish and optimize governance in Azure. Use this methodology to prevent problems that can block your progress, like Tailwind Traders' policy that doesn't align with their cloud adoption plans. The govern methodology consists of five steps:

1. Build a cloud governance team.  

1. Assess cloud risks.
1. Document cloud governance policies.
1. Enforce cloud governance policies.
1. Monitor cloud governance.

## Assess your cloud governance

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides a [cloud governance assessment](/assessments/b1891add-7646-4d60-a875-32a4ab26327e/) to help you identify how well your cloud governance aligns with best practices.

You can use the cloud governance assessment to get personalized recommendations to help you assess your current state, establish a vision for applying the framework, and work toward your future state.

## Governance foundation

<maybe remove or just focus on tools. Note Blueprints in image.>

Azure has a suite of governance tools that are built on top of the Azure Resource Manager platform. The initial governance foundation demonstrates how you can apply these tools to demonstrate cloud governance. As you progress through the units of this module, you learn how to apply these tools to solve governance challenges. First, start with a governance foundation to familiarize yourself with the tools.

In later units, you apply these tools to create a governance foundation for Tailwind Traders.
