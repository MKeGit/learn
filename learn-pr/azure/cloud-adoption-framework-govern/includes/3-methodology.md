To implement proper cloud governance, you need proper business policy, protective guardrails, and skilled people that provide consistent, disciplined governance.

## Build governance maturity

Use the following steps to get started with the Govern methodology in the cloud. Adhere to the steps along your cloud adoption journey to build a mature cloud governance solution.

1. **Understand the Govern methodology**. Understand the underlying methodology.

1. **Determine your governance benchmark**. Assess your current-state and future-state needs.
1. **Establish your governance foundation**. Use governance tools to establish your governance foundation.
1. **Make continuous improvements**. Iteratively add governance controls to address risks.

## Use the Govern methodology

The Govern methodology provides a structured approach that you can use to establish and optimize governance in Azure. The govern methodology consists of five steps:

- Build a cloud governance team.  

- Assess cloud risks.
- Document cloud governance policies.
- Enforce cloud governance policies.
- Monitor cloud governance.

## Build a cloud governance team

You must first form a cloud governance team to oversee cloud governance in your organization.

**Select the right team members.** Select a small and diverse team to encourage quick decision-making and to include various perspectives. Define the roles and responsibilities of each team member.

**Define the functions of your team.** A cloud governance team should engage stakeholders, assess cloud risks, develop and update governance policies, and monitor and review governance. You can add more functions if needed.

**Define your team's authority and scope.** Ensure that your organization supports your cloud governance team so that you can enforce important security policies. Clearly define the scope of your cloud governance team's authority, and separate their scope from other teams' responsibilities.

## Assess your cloud governance

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides a [cloud governance assessment](/assessments/b1891add-7646-4d60-a875-32a4ab26327e/) to help you identify how well your cloud governance aligns with best practices.

You can use the cloud governance assessment to get personalized recommendations to help you assess your current state, establish a vision for applying the framework, and work toward your future state.

## Governance foundation

Azure has a suite of governance tools that are built on top of the Azure Resource Manager platform. As you progress through the units of this module, you learn how to apply some of these tools to solve governance challenges.
