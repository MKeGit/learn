Implementing proper cloud governance requires proper business policy, protective guardrails, and skilled people taking a consistent, disciplined approach to governance.

## Build governance maturity

This unit explains the four-step process in the Cloud Adoption Framework to build a mature cloud-governance solution:

1. **Methodology**: Understand the underlying methodology
1. **Governance benchmark**: Assess your current-state and future-state needs
1. **Governance foundation**: Establish your governance foundation by using a set of governance tools
1. **Mature governance disciplines**: Iteratively add governance controls to address risks

These steps get you started using the Govern methodology in the cloud. They also set you on a path to mature governance discipline as your cloud adoption plan progresses.

## Govern methodology

The Govern methodology provides a structured approach to building the governance maturity that's required for confidence in cloud adoption.

## Corporate policy

*Governance* is a large subject, and it might be intimidating at first. Governance seeks to establish the proper scope of corporate actions by mitigating tangible risks through corporate policy.

## Cloud governance assessment \<replacement for benchmark tool>

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides a cloud governance assessment to help you identify gaps in the governance disciplines and corporate policy in your organization.

You can use the cloud governance assessment for a personalized report that outlines the difference between your current state and business priorities. The cloud governance assessment  also includes tailored resources to help you start assessing your current state and future state, and establish a vision for applying the framework.

## Governance foundation

Azure includes a suite of governance tools that are built on top of the Azure Resource Manager platform. The initial governance foundation demonstrates how you can apply these tools to demonstrate cloud governance. As you progress through the units of this module, you learn how to apply these tools to solve governance challenges. First, start with a governance foundation to familiarize yourself with the tools.

In later units, you apply these tools to create a governance foundation for Tailwind Traders.
