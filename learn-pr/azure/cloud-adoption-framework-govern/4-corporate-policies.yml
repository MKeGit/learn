  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "This policy is currently in place at Tailwind Traders: *Customer and financial data can only be hosted in a specific network segment of the existing datacenters, referred to as protected assets.* Is it a well-structured, scalable, and actionable policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The policy creates solution dependence and doesn't outline the actual concerns or risks.
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! This policy isn't well structured and would create many problems during cloud adoption.
  - content: What should be the first step in addressing the existing policy?
    choices:
    - content: Deploy a governance foundation to set up governance tools in Azure.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The tools can be used to create a similar policy or to learn about Azure governance, but they might not solve the deeper issue.
    - content: Enforce cloud governance policy.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Before new policies can be enforced, the policy needs to be updated.
    - content: Analyze the risks, determine the risk levels, and document and share the data related to the risks.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct! Learning the tools and enforcing the policy are both important. But you must first analyze risks so that you can define a policy to mitigate those risks.
