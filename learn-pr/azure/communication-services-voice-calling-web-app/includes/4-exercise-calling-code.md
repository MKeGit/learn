In this unit, you add more code to the web app created in the previous unit. This app enables you to make voice calls by using Azure Communication Services.

## Add input HTML elements

To make a call, you need two important pieces of information:

1. An Azure Communication Services user access token for the user making the call. This token identifies and authorizes the user to contact the service and initiate voice calling.
1. Who the user wants to call (represented by an Azure Communication Services user ID).

To get this information from the user, you use some standard HTML form inputs. Add these inputs to our *index.html* file:

1. Open the *index.html* file in a text editor.
1. Add the following HTML into the body of the HTML file, after the `<!-- Calling HTML here -->` comment:

    ```html
    <input 
        id="token-input"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Your User access token"
    />
    <button id="token-submit" type="button">
        Submit
    </button>
    <br /><br />
    <input 
        id="callee-id-input"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Who would you like to call?"
        style="margin-bottom:1em; width: 200px; display: block;"
    />
    ```

The first input element is for the token of the user making the call. The submit button is used to instantiate some Azure Communication Services objects after the token is provided. The second input is for entering the user ID of the person we want to call.

## Add basic call action buttons

You also need buttons for some basic call actions that allow the user to control the call:

1. **Start Call**
1. **Hang Up**

So let's also add these buttons underneath the inputs from the previous step:

```html
<button id="call-button" type="button" disabled="true">
    Start Call
</button>
&nbsp;
<button id="hang-up-button" type="button" disabled="true">
    Hang Up
</button>
```

## Testing the HTML

Now that the HTML is entered, you completed most of the code for this app. If you run the app by entering the same command from the previous unit (`npx parcel index.html`) and then open the app, you should see the following app in your browser.

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-html-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the blank web app showing in a browser.":::

This app doesn't look like a lot, but it contains all the visual elements you need to create a voice calling app. You're now done entering the HTML code for your app. The rest of the code is JavaScript.

## Import some dependencies

The first step within the *app.js* file is to import the dependencies for making Azure Communication Services calls. These dependencies come from the SDKs you installed earlier by using npm. To import them, add the following lines to the *app.js* file:

```javascript
import { CallClient } from "@azure/communication-calling";
import { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential } from '@azure/communication-common';
```

The first import is a `CallClient` to be used later to actually make our calls. It handles microphones, audio, and more for you. The second import, `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential`, is used to handle the authentication requirements for Azure Communication Services. Authentication ensures you know who a user is when they place a call.

## Getting references to our HTML

Earlier, you created HTML elements for users to use to control the app. To listen to the user interacting with them, you need to get references to the elements in your JavaScript.

You also need a couple of variables to hold some items, which are used throughout our code. Add the following code to *app.js* after the import statements:

```javascript
const userToken = document.getElementById("token-input"); 
const submitToken = document.getElementById("token-submit");

const calleeInput = document.getElementById("callee-id-input");

const callButton = document.getElementById("call-button");
const hangUpButton = document.getElementById("hang-up-button");

let call;
let callAgent;
let tokenCredential;
```

## Handling authentication

Now that you completed some basic setup, you can start creating some functionality. The first thing you need functionally is to handle authentication. Authentication is handled by the user entering a user token into the token input element that you created and then clicking your "submit token." To handle this process within your code, register a click handler to that submit token button, which processes the user token. You can add this code after your variable definitions from the previous section:

```javascript
submitToken.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const callClient = new CallClient();
  const userTokenCredential = userToken.value;

  try {
    tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userTokenCredential);
    callAgent = await callClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential);
    callAgent.on('incomingCall', incomingCallHandler);

    callButton.disabled = false;
    submitToken.disabled = true;
  } catch(error) {
    window.alert("Please submit a valid token!");
  }
});
```

This code takes the following actions:

1. Creates an Azure Communication Services call client.
1. Retrieves the user token from the token input element, and creates an `AzureCommunicationTokenCredential` from it. This credential is used to make and handle all calls.
1. Creates a `CallAgent`, which you use to make and receive calls.
1. Registers an incoming call handler, which you'll write shortly.
1. Updates some of our buttons so the user can proceed.

## Making calls

Now that authentication is out of the way, you can start on some real functionality. Let's start by allowing the user to make a call:

```javascript
callButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // start a call
  const userToCall = calleeInput.value;
  call = callAgent.startCall(
    [{ id: userToCall }],
    {}
  );

  // toggle button states
  hangUpButton.disabled = false;
  callButton.disabled = true;
});
```

This code registers a click handler on the **Start Call** button. It retrieves the callee ID from the matching input element and then uses the Call Agent to make a call.

## Hanging up

After a call is opened, you need to allow the user to hang up:

```javascript
hangUpButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // end the current call
  call.hangUp({ forEveryone: true });

  // toggle button states
  hangUpButton.disabled = true;
  callButton.disabled = false;
});
```

This code registers a click handler on the **Hang Up** button and then just instructs the call to hang up.

## Receive a call

Now that you can make a call, you also need to handle receiving a call. To handle receiving a call, you create the incoming call handler, which was mentioned earlier:

```javascript
const incomingCallHandler = async (args) => {
  const incomingCall = args.incomingCall;

  // Accept the call
  await incomingCall.accept();

  // Subscribe to callEnded event and get the call end reason
  incomingCall.on('callEnded', args => {
      console.log(args.callEndReason);
  });
};
```

## Testing

The JavaScript code is also done now. Run the app by using the same command as the previous unit (`npx parcel index.html`) and then open the app in your browser. You now have a functional basic calling app!

### Getting test credentials

To test actually making a call, you need some credentials. You can obtain credentials from the Azure portal. Open your Azure Communication Services resource within the Azure portal, and then select **Settings** > **Identities & User Access Tokens** within the communication service menu:

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-identities-menu-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the Identities & User Access Tokens menu option highlighted." lightbox="../media/4-identities-menu-option.png":::

On the page that appears, you can generate test credentials. For this app, you just need the **Voice and video calling (VOIP)** permission, so check that option, and then select **Generate**:

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-generate-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the token generation window in which the VOIP option is checked." lightbox="../media/4-generate-button.png":::

You get a single Azure Communication Services identity that's suitable for testing. Make sure to copy the **Identity** and the **User Access token** values to somewhere safe for testing, such as a text document.

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-test-credentials.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the token generation window in which the test credentials are showing." lightbox="../media/4-test-credentials.png":::

If you want to try calling another user, generate an extra set of credentials by selecting **Generate** again. New values are created in the **Identity** and the **User Access token** fields.

The first set of credentials is used for the calling user, and the second set is used for the receiving user.

In a real world app, you should use the identity systems and client libraries to create and store these credentials. This way, a real-world user doesn't need to manually copy and enter these items. For more info on this concept, open the links at the end of this module.

### Calling the Echo Bot

Azure Communication Services has an Echo Bot, which you can call to test your microphone. Echo Bot is compatible with this app. To call the Echo Bot:

1. Open the app in your browser.
1. Paste a saved token into the user token input element.
1. Select the **Submit** button.
1. Enter the Echo Bot's user ID (`8:echo123`).
1. Select **Start Call**.

Your browser might prompt you in some microphone permission dialogs, so make sure you accept them. If everything works out correctly, you should be on a call with the Echo Bot. The bot enables you to record a short message, which it then plays back to you.

### Calling another user

You can also call another user by using this app. This action requires a second set of credentials, which you generated earlier. Follow these steps:

1. Open two copies of the app. Use multiple tabs or windows to simulate calling another user.
1. In the first copy, enter the first user token saved from the credential generator, and then select **Submit**.
1. In the second copy, enter the second user token saved from the credential generator, and then select **Submit**.
1. Return to the first copy, and then enter the second user ID into the **Who would you like to call?** input element.
1. Again in the first copy, select **Start Call**.

If both tabs or windows are on the same device, the call might have echoes, but it does show the process and the calls working between two browser tabs. If you deploy your app to a web server that multiple machines can access, you can have a true voice call without echo.
