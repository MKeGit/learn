The external and internal developer teams want to work together, so you decide to create guest user access for the external developer team. 

Use the Azure portal to invite business-to-business (B2B) collaboration users. You can invite guest users to a Microsoft Entra organization, group, or application. After you invite a user, their account is added to Microsoft Entra ID, with a guest user type.

After you add a guest user to the organization, send them a direct link to a shared app. Have the guest user open the redemption URL in the invitation email.

## Add guest users to the organization

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), and under **Azure services**, select **Microsoft Entra ID**. The **Overview** pane for your Microsoft Entra ID appears.

1. In the left menu pane, under **Manage**, select **Users**. The **All users** pane appears.
