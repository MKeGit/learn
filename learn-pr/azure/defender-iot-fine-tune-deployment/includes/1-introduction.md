Microsoft Defender for IoT provides comprehensive threat detection for IoT/OT networks, with multiple deployment options that include cloud-connected, fully on-premises, or hybrid environments.

This module describes the steps required to fine-tune and calibrate a cloud-connected sensor on Defender for IoT for operational technology (OT) monitoring.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work for a car manufacturer that has offices and production sites across the globe. You're tasked with implementing a system to monitor traffic and secure your manufacturing automation systems, from the access panels to the pneumatic and packaging systems. To take your organization's OT security visibility to a whole new level, your team chooses to use Microsoft Defender for IoT.

The OT sensor is activated and the devices are now mirroring data to the sensor. You're tasked with fine-tuning the OT sensor. You need to verify that your sensor detects the interfaces and traffic you want to monitor and alerts you correctly for risky network activity. When your sensor identifies a baseline of network traffic, youâ€™re ready to switch out of learning mode into operation mode.

## What will we be doing?

In this module, you'll:

- Calibrate the sensor using the Analyze feature to detect the subnets and devices
- Fine-tune the defined subnets by reviewing the subnets detected by your sensor and updating the subnet data to match your network
- Fine-tune the devices by reviewing the detected devices and updating the details for selected devices
- Create a baseline of OT network traffic by triaging alerts and adding them to your network baseline

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you're able to fine tune and calibrate your OT sensor, ensuring that it sends accurate and filtered data. You're also able to triage the network alerts, making sure that they're created when suspicious traffic is detected. This completes the sensor deployment process to Defender for IoT.
