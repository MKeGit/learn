title: Fine-tune your Microsoft Defender for IoT OT sensor

summary: "After onboarding a sensor and deploying Defender for IoT, control the traffic monitored by your sensor and create a baseline of the OT network traffic. Fine-tune the defined subnets and devices. Then triage alerts while in learning mode to create a baseline. When ready, put the sensor into operational mode."
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you're able to:
    - Control the traffic monitored by your sensor by fine-tuning the subnets defined and detected device details
    - Create a baseline of OT network traffic for your sensor to compare against when learning mode is completed
    - Update the sensor from learning to operational mode when alerts accurately represent the network activity
prerequisites: |
  - Knowledge of what Defender for IoT is and how it works at a beginner level
  - Access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) as a Security Admin, Contributor, or Owner
  - A Defender for IoT license with an [OT plan](/azure/defender-for-iot/organizations/getting-started)
  - Access to an installed sensor that's receiving network traffic
