Azure Cloud Shell is a command-line environment you can access through your web browser. You can use this environment to manage Azure resources, including VMs, storage, and networking. Just like you do when using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell.

Because Microsoft manages Cloud Shell, you always have access to the most recent versions of the Azure CLI and PowerShell modules right from any browser. You don't have to worry about keeping modules up to date. With Cloud Shell, you just open your browser and sign in. Just like that, you have access to a command-line environment fully connected with your account's permissions and the resources to which you have access. All that works in an infrastructure that's compliant with double encryption at rest by default. You don't need to take any further action!

Azure Cloud Shell also provides cloud storage to persist files such as SSH keys, scripts, and more. This functionality lets you access important files in between sessions and with different machines. Finally, you can use the Cloud Shell editor to make changes to files, such as scripts, that are saved into this cloud storage directly from the Cloud Shell interface.
