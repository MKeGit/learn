In this exercise, you create an Azure Static Web Apps instance including a GitHub Action that automatically builds and publishes your application.

## Create a Static Web App

Now that you created your GitHub repository, you can create a Static Web Apps instance from the Azure portal.

This module uses the Azure sandbox to provide you with a free, temporary Azure subscription you can use to complete the exercise. Before proceeding, make sure that you activate the sandbox at the top of this page.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), making sure you use the same account to sign in as you did to activate the sandbox.

1. On the Azure **home** page, under **Azure services**, select **Create a resource**. The **Create a resource** pane appears.

1. In the *marketplace* search box, search for and select **Static Web App**. The **Static Web App** pane appears.

1. Select **Create**. The **Create Static Web App** pane appears. Configure your new app and link it to your GitHub repository.

1. On the **Basics** tab, enter the following values for each setting.

   | Setting          | Value                                    |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
   | **Project Details** |
   | Subscription  | Concierge Subscription               |
   | Resource Group | <rgn>[Sandbox resource group name]</rgn> |
   | **Static Web App details** |
   | Name  | Name your app. Valid characters are `a-z` (case insensitive), `0-9`, and `-`. |
   | **Hosting plan** |
   | Pricing tier for your application | Select **Free** |
   | **Azure Functions and staging details** |
   | Region for Azure Functions API and staging environments | Select the region closest to you |
   | **Deployment details** |
   | Source | Select **GitHub** |
   | GitHub account | Select **Sign in with GitHub**. The **Authorize Azure Static Web Apps** pane appears. Select **Authorize Azure-App-Service-Static-Web-Apps**. Enter your password. |
   | Organization | Select the Organization where you created the repository |
   | Repository   | my-static-blazor-app                                |
   | Branch       | main                                                 |
   | **Build Details** |
   | Build Presets | Blazor |
   | App location          | Client  |
   | Api location         | Api     |
   | Output location | wwwroot |

1. Select **Review + create** > **Create**.

1. After deployment completes, select **Go to resource**. Your **Static Web App** pane appears.

### Review the GitHub Action

At this stage, your Static Web Apps instance is created in Azure, but your app isn't yet deployed. The GitHub Action that Azure creates in your repository runs automatically to trigger the first build and deployment of your app, but it takes a couple minutes to finish.

You can check the status of your build and deploy action by selecting the following link to go to the **Actions** page of your GitHub repository:

:::image type="content" source="../media/goto-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to browse to see the progress of the GitHub Actions workflow.":::

After you're there:

1. Select **Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD**.

1. Select the commit titled, **ci: add Azure Static Web Apps workflow file**.

1. Select the **Build and Deploy Job** link

From here, you can observe the progress of your app as it builds.

### View website

After your GitHub Action finishes building and publishing your web app, you can browse to see your running app.

Select the *URL* link in the Azure portal to visit your app in the browser.

:::image type="content" source="../media/static-web-apps-resource-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Static Web Apps overview page.":::

Your app is now globally available, but still says *Loading data* because there's no data or API yet. You'll add the API for your web app in the next section.

Congratulations! You deployed your first app to Azure Static Web Apps!

> [!NOTE]
> Don't worry if you see a web page that says the app hasn't been built and deployed yet. Try refreshing the browser in a minute. The GitHub Action runs automatically when the Azure Static Web Apps is created. So if you see the splash page, the app is still being deployed.

## Next steps

Your app is missing an API for its shopping list. Next, you explore how to add an Azure Functions API to your app that publishes to Azure alongside the static assets.
