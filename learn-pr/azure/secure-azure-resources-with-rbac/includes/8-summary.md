In this module, you learned about Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and how you can use it to secure your Azure resources. To grant access, you assign users a role at a particular scope. Using Azure RBAC, you can grant only the amount of access to users that they need to perform their jobs. Azure RBAC has more than 200 built-in roles, but if your organization needs specific permissions, you can create your own custom roles. Azure keeps track of your Azure RBAC changes in case you need to see what changes were made in the past.
