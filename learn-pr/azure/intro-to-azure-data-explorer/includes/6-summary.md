Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Azure Data Explorer is a good choice to process and analyze your big data. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:

* Interactive analytics
* Data variety
* Data velocity
* Data volume
* Data organization
* Query concurrency
* Build vs buy

We applied these criteria to fit our fictional clothing company. The analysis showed us how different domains in the company, such as operations, production, marketing, and security could use Azure Data Explorer to make sense of the data flowing in from their daily operations.

These criteria help you evaluate whether your business processes are a good match for Azure Data Explorer. First, they give you an idea of the types and volumes of data that are appropriate for use with Azure Data Explorer. Second, they give you an idea of customization and user behavior that most benefits from work in Azure Data Explorer. This process should give you enough information to choose the right product for your work.
