## Overview:

Azure CycleCloud aims to simplify the management of large scale, dynamic HPC environments. As compute sizes increase, and customer workloads become more scalable, itâ€™s essential to ensure that all the VMs deployed for the cluster are available for jobs. 

Node Health checks (NHCs) checks ensure network interfaces, InfiniBand connectivity, and GPUs are functioning properly. It avoids the delays associated with job prologues and custom scheduler integration. This proactive approach prevents users from encountering failures later on.

NHCs are conducted as nodes join the cluster and the process also includes checks during overprovisioning. This verification occurs before the nodes are registered with the scheduler. 

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from CycleCloud v8.5, NHCs can be configured from the CycleCloud Slurm cluster web portal under the _Advanced Settings_ tab. Running NHC will add startup time to healthy nodes which can take up to 10 minutes. For more information on how to enable the NHC, see [Node Health Checks](/azure/cyclecloud/how-to/healthcheck).

Azure CycleCloud supports the new H-series VMs out of the box and N-series, but for the best experience and performance, follow the guidelines and best practices. For more information about CycleCloud supported VMs, see [GPU optimized virtual machine sizes](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu) and [HPC optimized virtual machine sizes](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-hpc).

### Health checks

Many of the hardware checks are part of the default NHC project. If you would like to learn more, check out the [Node Health Checks project](https://github.com/mej/nhc).

The following are Azure custom checks added to the existing NHC suite of tests:
