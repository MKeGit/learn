## Access control

![Access Control category.](../media/policies/access-control.png)

### Why ask these questions

These questions allow you to:

- Come up with a complete list of user types, like employees, administrators, and vendors.
- Know who is authorized to access resources.
- Learn which security controls are used to restrict access, like Role-based Access Control (RBAC), Access Control Lists (ACL), or least-privilege access.
- Find out which identity management system is used by the enterprise, like Microsoft Entra ID.
- Learn which security controls are used to authenticate users, like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Single-Sign-On (SSO).
