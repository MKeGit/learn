In this module, we explored the benefits of using Azure NetApp Files to extend your Azure VMware Solution (AVS) configuration. Azure NetApp Files with AVS is designed for situations where:

- You need to scale your storage and anticipate fluctuating storage demands.
- You want to scale storage independent of compute, creating lower TCO.
- You want a highly performant storage solution with built-in data protection features such as snapshots, backup, and replication.

We've also learned how to configure of Azure NetApp Files with AVS, covering:

- How to configure connectivity between your AVS private cloud and the Azure NetApp Files service.
- How to appropriately size volumes based on workload demands.
- How to connect Azure NetApp Files volumes as datastores to AVS hosts.
- How to connect your Azure NetApp Files volumes to an AVS VM.


Azure NetApp Files can support your most demanding enterprise workloads by providing excellent storage performance, maximum availability, and the flexibility to scale as your requirements change.
