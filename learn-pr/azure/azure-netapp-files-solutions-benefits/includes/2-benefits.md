Azure NetApp Files offers benefits with numerous products. 

## Benefits of using Azure NetApp Files with Oracle Database  
 -**Flexibility:** You can enlarge or reduce capacity and throughput on demand to align your configuration to the actual business needs without interruption to the service.
- **Scalability:** Use multiple storage volumes and add volumes on the fly to expand both capacity and throughput as needed
- **Availability:** Volumes are built on highly available fault-tolerant bare-metal fleet powered by ONTAP with built-in replication capabilities for business continuity and disaster recovery.
- **Consolidation:** Run multiple smaller database instances on an Azure VM while maintaining isolation of the database and log files over multiple storage volumes.
- **Data protection:** Space-efficient snapshot copies provide application-consistent point in time copies of live databases, and snapshot copies can be backed up by Azure NetApp Files backup or third-party solutions as desired.
- **Cloning:** Snapshots can be cloned to provide current data copies to test and development.
- **Storage throughput:** Networked storage is subjected to higher throughput limits than managed disk. As a result, you can use smaller VM SKUs than you would with managed disk storage without degrading performance. This approach could significantly reduce costs.

## Benefits of Azure NetApp Files for Electronic Design Automation (EDA)

EDA workloads require file storage that can handle high file counts, large capacity, and a large number of parallel operations across potentially thousands of client workstations. EDA workloads also need to perform at a level that reduces the time it takes for testing and validation to complete so to save money on licenses and to expedite time to market for the latest and greatest chipsets. 

- Azure NetApp Files large volumes can handle the demands of an EDA workload with performance comparable to what would be seen in on-premises deployments.
- Azure NetApp Files large volumes help reduce the time EDA jobs take with a highly performant, parallelized file system solution and time taken to market (TTT).

## Benefits of using Azure NetApp Files with Azure Virtual Desktop

- Azure NetApp Files is a highly performant file storage service from Azure. It can provide up to 450,000 IOPS and sub-millisecond latency, capable of supporting extremely large scale of Azure Virtual Desktop deployments.
- You can adjust the bandwidth and change the service level of your Azure NetApp Files volumes on demand almost instantaneously without pausing IO while retaining data plane access. This capability allows you to easily optimize your Azure Virtual Desktop deployment scale for cost. 

## Benefits of using Azure NetApp Files for SQL Server deployment

Azure NetApp Files reduces SQL Server total cost of ownership (TCO) as compared to block storage solutions. 

- No VM level I/O limits are applied to Azure NetApp Files. Without these I/O limits, SQL Server running on smaller virtual machines connected to Azure NetApp Files can perform as well as SQL Server running on much larger virtual machines. 
- Azure NetApp Files provides shared file access with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 
- Disk I/O limits on access rates that apply at the virtual machine (VM) level don't affect Azure NetApp Files. As a result, you can use smaller VMs than you would with disk storage without degrading performance. This approach significantly reduces costs.
- Azure NetApp Files offers flexibility. You can enlarge or reduce deployments on demand to make your configuration cost effective.
