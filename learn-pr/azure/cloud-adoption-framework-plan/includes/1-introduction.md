Cloud adoption is a change-management exercise. You make several technical decisions and efforts along the way, but the ultimate success of any cloud-adoption effort is defined by the quality of your cloud-adoption plan.

In this module, you learn how to build rich, data-driven cloud adoption plans.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Create an actionable cloud adoption plan.
- Understand your digital estate.
- Assess the digital estate with Azure Migrate and refine your plan.
- Establish a skills-readiness plan to prepare the team.

## Prerequisites

- Foundational understanding of cloud adoption.
- Understanding of your organization's adoption strategy and the types of efforts you need to complete.
- Basic familiarity with Azure DevOps or other tools used to manage tasks to create a plan.
- To complete the hands-on portion of the assessment unit, you need a functioning version of Azure Migrate with data regarding local servers, applications, and data. If one isn't already available, complete [set up Azure Migrate for server migration](/training/modules/m365-azure-migrate-set-up/?azure-portal=true) to provide the necessary environment. For project manager roles, you can skip the hands-on tooling section of that unit.
