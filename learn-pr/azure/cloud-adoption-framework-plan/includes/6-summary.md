In this module, you deployed your first cloud-adoption plan, assessed a digital estate, and updated the cloud-adoption plan to track the work required for you to be successful.

## Next steps

Continue to improve your planning skills with the [Plan methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. The following outline a few of the things you can improve with that methodology:

- Use your plan and assessment data to [improve cost forecasts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/calculate).
- [Align your people across the organization for initial cloud adoption efforts](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/initial-org-alignment).
- [Build a skills readiness plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/adapt-roles-skills-processes) to better prepare your team for the work to be done.
- Learn more about [cloud adoption rationalization](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/5-rs-of-rationalization) to make the right decisions for your portfolio of workloads.
- Integrate assessment data into your plan at scale by using Microsoft Excel with the following [article series](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/review-rationalization).
