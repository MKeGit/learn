Your Alpine Ski House web app is up and running, but now you need to show it to your boss. You're going to have to update the site and publish those updates to Azure.

## Update your web app

### Replace the boilerplate code

1. In the **Pages** folder, open the **Privacy.cshtml** file.

1. At the bottom of the code, locate 
    `<p>Use this page to detail your site's privacy policy.</p>`.

1. Replace this boilerplate text with
    `<p>Welcome to the Alpine Ski House!</p>`.

1. Save the file.

1. Open the **Index.cshtml** file.

1. Replace the content within the `<p>` tags to say
    **Alpine Ski House is the premier ski hill in the Northeast!**

1. Save the file.

### Publish your updates

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project.

1. Select **Publish**. A new tab named **AlpineSkiHouse** should open.

1. Select the **Publish** button to deploy the latest changes.

### View your changes

Once you've published your changes, Visual Studio opens the site in your browser. You should now see your new messages on the home and privacy pages.

Congratulations, you've successfully updated your web app from within Visual Studio 2022.
