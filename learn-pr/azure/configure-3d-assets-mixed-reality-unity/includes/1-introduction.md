A well-designed user experience in Unity for mixed reality requires carefully designing and creating a Unity Scene. A Scene is like a blank canvas, which you'll develop into an experience for your end user. Provide context for your user as they navigate the Scene by adding supportive information like satellite imagery, or lower-fidelity supportive information (for example, surrounding warehouse infrastructure). Once you've established context for the Scene, you need to create and add the 3D assets or models for your Digital Twin. These will be the showcase of your experience.

## Example scenario

You'll continue to build out the example wind-farm scenario from previous modules, except this time you're looking to add reusable wind turbine objects to the project's terrain.

## What will we learn?

For your wind-farm use case, you'll add wind turbine Assets to your Scene that we've created for you. Assets that have been created in advance, complete with configuration parameters, are called Prefabs. If you completed the previous module, **Build a 3D Scene for Mixed Reality in Unity**, you're already familiar with Prefabs and used static and dynamic terrain Prefabs.

In this module, you'll explore Prefabs in more detail and use them to build out your Scene to prepare your wind farm for operations. You'll add 3D Prefabs that you can connect to cloud services such as Azure Digital Twin to operationalize your Digital Twins and bring them to life.

## What is the main goal?

Building a Scene is an important initial step in developing your Mixed Reality experience. By the end of this module, you'll be able to work with Unity Prefabs, Scriptable Objects, and Mixed Reality Toolkit interactions.
