  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
    - content: "Which Azure Service helps developers to create an application to detect an object in the physical world?"
      choices:
        - content: "Azure Spatial Anchors"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Spatial Anchors empowers developers with essential capabilities to build spatially aware mixed reality applications. 
        - content: "Azure Object Anchors"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Azure Object Anchors is a service from Azure to detect Objects in physical world. 
        - content: "Azure Cloud Service"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Azure Cloud Services is an example of a platform as a service (PaaS). Like Azure App Service, this technology is designed to support applications that are scalable, reliable, and cost-effective to operate.
    - content: "Which statement is not correct?"
      choices:
        - content: "Recommended size of the model object is between 1-10 meters"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: To ensue that object is detected the size of the model should be between 1-10 meters.
        - content: "Scanned object should have 1:1 match with the model you trained with"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: When you are creating the 3D model ensure that created 3D model size matches with the real-time model in your physical space.
        - content: "Azure Object Anchors also supports 2D"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Since Azure Object Anchors is geometry-based, it only supports 3D
    - content: "Which of the following points is incorrect when developing a 3D model for an Object Anchors model?"
      choices:
        - content: "Have to define the correct direction of the gravity vector of the 3D model"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The 3D vector gives the downward direction in the coordinate system of your model.
        - content: "Supported file formats of 3D model are fbx, ply, obj, glb, and gltf"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Currently 3D models that are supported are fbx, ply, obj, glb, and gltf for conversion.
        - content: "Model will have the same extension as the original file after object conversion"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Once the model is converted the output model will have filename.ou extention.
