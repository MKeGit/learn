You're the system administrator for a graphic design company. Your company creates large media files for online, broadcast, and print-based media. These files are stored on servers in your datacenter. The data is heavily compressed before customers download it via FTP for review. 

You plan to move all the files for collaboration or review into Azure Blob Storage. By giving customers direct access to the storage, they can review and retrieve their files more easily, saving time and effort.

You can use Blob Storage containers to store massive amounts of unstructured data in Azure. This data might include images, distributed files, streaming video, or audio. You can also use Blob Storage to store log files, backup data, and data for analysis, either on-premises or by using an Azure-hosted service. 

Monitoring is also essential for controlling storage costs in Azure by enabling your organization to effectively manage its use of storage. Over time, you might want to identify the demand on the platform to ensure that customers can retrieve files efficiently with little lag or delay. You also might want the ability to use log information to troubleshoot problems, such as if a customer can't access a certain file. In this module, you see how to monitor Blob Storage to ensure that you get the desired results from the service.

This module deals with metrics in Azure Monitor and their use in the portal, it doesn't include any developer subjects. A separate module covers how to use the Azure SDK and the Azure Monitor REST API to access metric data.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- View blob metrics in the Azure portal.
- Add Azure Monitor metrics charts to a custom portal dashboard.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of the Azure portal
- Knowledge of Azure Blob Storage containers
