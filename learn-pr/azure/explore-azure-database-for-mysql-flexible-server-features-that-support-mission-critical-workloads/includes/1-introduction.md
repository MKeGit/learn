Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed MySQL database as a service (DBaaS) offering on Azure that can handle mission-critical workloads with resiliency, predictable performance, and dynamic scalability.

Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server has several features that support mission-critical operations. This module will cover features related to security, business continuity and disaster recovery, and performance.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at an e-commerce startup, Wingtip Toys (WT). You've been using an on-premises infrastructure and want to leverage Azure cloud services. WT has grown and is launching a major marketing campaign next quarter. You expect site traffic and purchases to go up significantly. Naturally, database uptime is crucial to the e-commerce site and to accommodate incoming customer orders. 

WT's technology department has grown and now includes a data science team in addition to the product development team. The data science team runs large reporting and analytics queries. In the past, experiments with reporting have caused database performance problems, and you want to make sure the data science team can do their job without affecting the main site. 

In addition, as WT hires more employees, their DBA team has struggled to keep up with managing users and permissions. With the migration to Azure, you want to centralize user management, authentication, and authorization. 

You want to keep using MySQL, but you also know that Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server provides features that are not readily available on self-hosted databases. You also want to review Azure’s MySQL features to maximize your cloud migration value. 

## What you will do

You'll learn about, evaluate, and compare the Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Servers features, including security, business continuity, high availability, backups, performance, IOPS, and read replicas, that support mission-critical operations. 

## Primary goal

By the end of this module, you should better understand the features provided by Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server designed to support mission–critical workloads.
