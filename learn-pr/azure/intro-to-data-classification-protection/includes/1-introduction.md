Contoso, Ltd. is a medium-size financial-services company in London with a New York branch office. Most of its environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. However, the organization is evaluating its cloud services.

Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation, and it relies on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team is exploring the capabilities of Microsoft Azure and the Microsoft 365 platform. They want to determine whether Contoso can use Azure services to help modernize its current operational model through automation and virtualization. Theyâ€™re also considering using Microsoft 365 productivity services. These services would replace Contoso's locally deployed services such as email, intranet portals, or storage.
