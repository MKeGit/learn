In this unit, you learn how to create and find different types of resources in the Azure portal.

## Activate the Azure sandbox

1. Start by **activating the Azure sandbox above**.

1. Once it's activated, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true). Make sure to use the same account with which you activated the sandbox.

## Explore how to create resources

Now let's start exploring how to create resources in Azure. We won't actually create any Azure resources in this exercise.

1. On the home page, select **Create a resource**.

1. A pane labeled **Create a resource** appears. On the right-hand side, there's a list labeled **Popular Marketplace products**. Expand this list by selecting the **See more in Marketplace** link next to the heading.

1. Select the **X** icon in the upper right to return to the **Create a resource** pane.

1. Next, look at the **Popular Azure services** list on the left side of the pane. This list includes services such as Virtual machine, Key Vault, Function App, and more. Many of these items include **Docs** and/or **MS Learn** links directly below the name. These links open a new browser tab with content to help you learn about that service.

## Find resource types by category

1. In the left navigation pane, under **Categories**, select **Compute**. You'll now see options related to this category in the **Popular Azure services** and **Popular Marketplace products** lists.

1. To the right of **Popular Marketplace products**, select **See more in Marketplace**. The full list of available **Compute** offerings appears.

1. In the **Featured** section, select the option for **Windows Server**. If you don't see it, select **See more**.

1. Select the drop-down list under **Plan** to see all of the available Windows Server images.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Windows Server** window.

1. Select the **X** on the previous **Marketplace** window.

## Use search to filter results

Another way to locate services from the **Create a resource** pane is to use search terms. Searching is often the quickest way to filter the services that you see.

The search box at the top of the **Create a resource** pane defaults to checking every Azure service category to get its results. You can also refine your search by selecting a category.

1. Type `virtual machine` into the search box and select <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

1. In the left navigation pane, under **Categories**, select **Compute**. You'll see a filtered list of **Compute** offerings related to virtual machine images.

1. Select any of the results that interest you to learn more about that offering, including how to get started. Select the **X** in the corner to return to the list and explore a different offering. When you're done, move to the next step.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Marketplace** pane. The **Create a resource** pane is visible once again.

1. Select the **X** at the top right-hand corner to close the **Create a resource** pane.

Many of the principles you have learned in this exercise apply throughout the Azure portal experience. In the next unit, you continue your journey in the Azure portal and configure other settings in Azure.
