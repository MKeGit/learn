Azure Arc promises to bridge the gap between on-premises and cloud environments by providing a consistent operational approach with the agility, automation, and scalability of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you learn about the monitoring capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled servers.

Suppose you’re responsible for monitoring the infrastructure performance at Tailwind Manufacturing, a small industrial firm. As your company invests in its hybrid and multicloud environment, it has onboarded its non-Azure machines across its industrial floor and business offices to Azure Arc-enabled servers. One challenge is observability across your sprawling IT infrastructure. You want both smart and scalable alerting and a range of metrics, logs, and visualizations.

Through Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can use Azure’s robust monitoring plane through Log Analytics, VM insights, and Azure Dashboards to deliver enhanced observability across your hybrid environment. You can extend the same visibility you have into Azure resources to your resources that are outside of Azure.
