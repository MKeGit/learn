Tailwind Manufacturing has onboarded its machines to Azure Arc-enabled servers, and now wants to use VM insights. In this Unit, you learn how to configure and collect data from your Azure Arc-enabled servers by enabling VM insights.

## Enable VM insights

You can apply VM extensions to your Arc-enabled server by using the following steps in the Azure portal:

1. From your browser, navigate to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com/>.

1. Navigate to **Servers - Azure Arc** and select your hybrid machine from the list.

1. From the left-pane under the **Monitoring** section, select **Insights**, and then select **Enable**.

    On the Azure Monitor Insights Onboarding page, you're prompted to create a workspace. You can either select an existing Log Analytics workspace or select the default. The default is a configured workspace with a unique name in the same region as the Azure Arc-enabled server.

    With VM insights enabled, you get a message that the machine has been successfully onboarded to VM insights. This process takes a few minutes while extensions are installed on your connected machine.

## View collected data

After the deployment and configuration is completed, you can view your collected data by using the following steps in the Azure portal:

1. From your browser, navigate to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com/>.

1. Select **Insights**, and then select the **Performance** tab. This tab shows you a select group of performance counters collected from the guest operating system of your machine at the top.

1. over over a graph to view averages and percentiles taken starting from the time when the Log Analytics VM extension was installed on the machine.

1. Select **Properties** to open the property pane if it isn't already open.

1. Select your machine again and then select **Log Events**. You get a list of tables that are stored in the Log Analytics workspace for the machine.

1. Select **Event** table. The **Event** table includes all events from the Windows event log. Log Analytics opens with a simple query to retrieve collected event log entries.
