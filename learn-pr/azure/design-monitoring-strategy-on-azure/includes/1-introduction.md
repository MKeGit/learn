Suppose you work for a financial organization that's moving its systems to Azure, with a mixture of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services. The organization's previous on-premises environment experienced instances of degraded application performance or unavailable systems, with extended delays before the issues were identified and resolved. Customers' inability to access their accounts decreased their satisfaction.

To quickly identify and minimize poor performance and system failures in the future, the organization wants to implement a full-stack monitoring strategy across all its technology solutions. This strategy should offer insights and alerting into collected data.

In this learning module, you explore the monitoring solutions available in Azure. You learn how to use Azure Monitor and its features, such as Application Insights and Azure Monitor Logs, to analyze infrastructure and application performance and availability. You also explore how to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel for security monitoring.

After you complete this module, you can use Azure tools to design and implement a full-stack monitoring strategy for your infrastructure and applications.

## Learning objectives

- Select the appropriate monitoring solutions based on use cases.
- Choose a combination of monitoring solutions to create a unified full-stack monitoring strategy.

## Prerequisites

  - Basic knowledge of Azure application, virtualization, and container services
  - Basic knowledge of operational concepts like monitoring, logging, and alerting
