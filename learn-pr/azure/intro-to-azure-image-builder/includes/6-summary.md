In this module, you learned about Azure Image Builder (AIB). The AIB service helps you automate the creation of custom virtual machine (VM) images. New and existing scripts, commands, and processes are then used so the VMs can take on workloads after the images are created.

You looked at using Azure Image Builder for your IT organization to provide cloud-based services to your customers when there are requests to deploy new software applications. To make the process easier, you saw how using the AIB service can create machine images from a single-source configuration and deploy these images to the customer's Azure environment. Without Azure Image Builder, creating custom VM images would be a manual and time-consuming process. By using Azure Image Builder, you can streamline this process and save time, which can have a significant business impact by reducing the time and effort required to create custom VM images.
