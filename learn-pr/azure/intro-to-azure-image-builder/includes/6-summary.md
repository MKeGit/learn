In this module, we learned about Azure Image Builder (AIB). The AIB service helps you automate the creation of custom virtual machine images. New and existing scripts, commands, and processes are then utilized so the VMs can take on workloads after the images are created. 

You looked at using Azure Image Builder for your IT organization to provide cloud-based services to your customers when there are requests to deploy new software applications. To make the process easier, you saw how using the AIB service can create machine images from a single source configuration and deploy them to the customer's Azure environment. Without Azure Image Builder, creating custom virtual machine images would be a manual and time-consuming process. With Azure Image Builder, you can streamline this process and save time, which can have a significant business impact by reducing the time and effort required to create custom virtual machine images.
