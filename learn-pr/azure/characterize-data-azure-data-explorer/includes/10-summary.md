In the scenario, you characterized an unfamiliar meteorological dataset. You looked at the raw data present in this dataset, and explored some of its properties in the results grid of Azure Data Explorer. You then used queries to further characterize the size and variability of the data, and visualized various data distributions.

Azure Data Explorer is a powerful tool that provides an end-to-end solution for data consumption and exploration. Now that you've completed this first step of data characterization, you're ready to dive in and use Azure Data Explorer to extract complex insights.
