You've looked at a sample of the data and manipulated this sample to group and sort the data entries. By now, you should have a general idea of the types of data and values present in the dataset.

## Explore data structure

Now that you've answered basic questions about the data present in your dataset, you can drill down into the dataset to find trends and insights in the data. Drilling down in data is, by nature, an iterative process.

For example, on the first pass, you can use simple queries to define the range of the dataset. While you've taken a broad look at the full data set, you can also use a query to investigate each column and its respective data type. You can then decide what columns you want to look at to summarize (aggregate) data. You can aggregate data by different subgroups to give counts and ranges (min/max) of certain fields. If you have dynamic data fields, you might want to expand them and see what kind of data is held within.

On the second pass, zoom out and use queries to visualize your data as a whole. By looking at a selection of the data table in the last unit, you've seen that you have time-series data, data grouped by state, and data with a specific location. You'll further use queries and the built-in visualizations to explore these different kinds of series and gain insights into their completeness and distribution.

## Share insights

Finally, you'll want to share your findings with others. Maybe you want to share a single query, or visualization result; or, you could share a whole dashboard. Communication is the final, important step of data exploration.

This process is a general pattern of data exploration for any new dataset, regardless of the specific structure and information it contains. The tools built into Azure Data Explorer can help you streamline this process and quickly move from unfamiliar data to shared insights.
