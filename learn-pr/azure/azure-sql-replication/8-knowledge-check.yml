quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the default retention policy for the change data capture (CDC) cleanup process?"
    choices: 
    - content: "1 day"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Review the change data capture (CDC) section."
    - content: "2 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Review the change data capture (CDC) section."
    - content: "3 days"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The CDC cleanup process is responsible for enforcing the retention-based cleanup policy. By default, three days of data are retained."
  - content: "Which of the following tools offers automatic or on-demand bi-directional data synchronization?"
    choices:
    - content: "Change Data Capture (CDC)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CDC tracks and loads data changes but keeps them on the same source database."
    - content: "SQL Data Sync"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. SQL Data Sync synchronizes the data changes either uni-directionally or bi-directionally."
    - content: "Change tracking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Change tracking checks whether a change happened on your table and what type of change happened."
  - content: "Which is the default function that CDC provides for querying all the changes on table within the specified LSN range?"
    choices:
    - content: "cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<capture_instance>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The function cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<capture_instance> is used to query for all changes on table within the specified LSN range."
    - content: "cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "If the capture instance is configured to support net changes, the enumeration function cdc.fn_cdc_get_net_changes_<capture_instance> also gets created which returns one net change row for each source row changed within the specified LSN range."
  - content: "You can enable SQL Data Sync on tables that don't have a primary key (PK)"
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Each table that you want to sync must have a primary key."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Each table that you want to sync must have a primary key."
  - content: "Which tool should I use if I want to identify whether an insert / update / delete was executed on my data, but without needing a historical record of my data changes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Change data capture (CDC)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CDC tracks insert, update, and delete activity that applies to a table and also records historical data changes."
    - content: "SQL Data Sync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "SQL Data Sync is used to synchronize the data you select bi-directionally across multiple databases, both on-premises and in the cloud."
    - content: "Change tracking"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Change tracking should be used to verify whether a row has changed and to get information about the change."
