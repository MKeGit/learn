Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Docker containers would be the right choice for your business process. We looked at the benefits that Docker containers introduce, as well as some aspects to consider in terms of when not to use Docker.

You were looking for a containerization solution that provides maximum compatibility in each environment with little or no configuration changes. We found that Docker is a good solution that lets us create a snapshot of our application and all its dependencies. We can then deploy this same snapshot in development, testing, and production.

Finally, Azure provides various deployment options to host Docker containers. In Azure, you can integrate containers with other Azure services to extend your product or exchange data with other services.
