  questions:
  - content: 'What does it mean to have an imbalanced dataset?'
    choices:
    - content: "The number of samples is much smaller or greater than is required"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "The feature columns contain many missing values"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "There are many more training examples that correspond to some outputs (categories) than others"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This can lead to the model learning to improve loss metrics by 'cheating.'"
  - content: 'What information can we extract from a single confusion matrix?'
    choices:
    - content: "Log loss, and/or mean squared error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Whether the dataset has overfit the training set"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "What kind of mistakes the model is making"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
  - content: 'Why don’t we use measures like “True Positives” or “Accuracy” to train our models directly?'
    choices:
    - content: "There are mathematical barriers that prevent these being used for some training regimens"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Subtle model improvements often do not affect these metrics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Both of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In fact, these answers are often related. Methods like gradient descent rely on measures of slope, which do not exist for non-smooth functions like accuracy."
