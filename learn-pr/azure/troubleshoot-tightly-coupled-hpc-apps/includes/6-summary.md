In this module, you learned:

- How to identify unhealthy high-performance computing (HPC) VMs by running several specific virtual machine (VM) health checks.
- How a single unhealthy VM can cause a tightly coupled HPC application to fail or run more slowly than expected.
- How to prepare to run a tightly coupled HPC parallel application optimally.
- How to troubleshoot HPC applications that run slowly.
