Imagine that you work on an R&D team for a car manufacturer. Your team is using Azure high-performance computing (HPC) resources to design and develop a new flagship sports car. 

Your team creates tightly coupled HPC applications on Azure HPC SKUs. However, they observe a few problems when running HPC jobs in Azure. Some tightly coupled Message Passing Interface (MPI) jobs failed to run correctly, and others performed more slowly than expected. Your team needs to troubleshoot why some of its HPC applications are having runtime failures, and why other HPC applications are performing below expectations.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Troubleshoot runtime failures for tightly coupled HPC applications.
- Troubleshoot tightly coupled HPC applications that are underperforming.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HPC concepts.
- Familiarity with building and running tightly coupled HPC applications on Azure.
