  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the benefit of the system-focused approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "This approach allows you to focus on one critical asset at a time to help identify all potential threats and ways to reduce or eliminate risk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement corresponds to the asset-focused approach."
    - content: "This approach provides information into a potential attacker, including their means, motive, and plan of action."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement corresponds to the attacker-focused approach."
    - content: "This approach allows you to focus on how the system handles users and data. It also validates security assumptions across physical and logical assets used with the service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The system-focused approach looks at the whole system, not just parts of it."
  - content: "What is the benefit of the attacker-focused approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "This approach allows you to focus on one critical asset at a time and identifies all potential threats and ways to reduce risk."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement describes the asset-focused approach."
    - content: "Instead of focusing on the service, this approach focuses on the attacker, their motivations and means to attack your system."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The attacker-focused approach is based on the attacker and their plan of attack."
    - content: "This approach provides information into the system, especially as it handles errors and requests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This statement describes the system-focused approach."
