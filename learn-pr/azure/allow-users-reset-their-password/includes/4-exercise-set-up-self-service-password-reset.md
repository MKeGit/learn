In this unit, you'll configure and test self-service password reset (SSPR) by using your email. You'll need to use your email to complete the password-reset process in this exercise.

## Create a group

You want to roll out SSPR to a limited set of users first to make sure your SSPR configuration works as expected. Let's begin by creating a security group for the limited rollout.

1. In the Microsoft Entra organization you created, under **Manage**, select **Groups**.
1. Select **New Group**.
1. Enter the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Group type | Security |
    | Group name | SSPRTesters |
    | Group description | Members are testing the rollout of SSPR |
    | Membership type | Assigned |
    | | |

1. Select **Create**.

## Create a user account

To test your configuration, create an account that's not associated with an administrator role. You'll also assign the account to the group you created.

1. In your Microsoft Entra organization, under **Manage**, select **Users**.
1. Select **+ New user**, select **Create new user** in the drop-down, and use the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User principal name | balas |
    | Display name | Bala Sandhu |
    | Password | Select the **Copy** icon next to the autogenerated password, then paste the password to a text editor like Notepad. |

1. Select the **Assignments** tab.

1. Select **Add group**, check the box for the **SSPRTesters** group, and then the **Select** button.

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.

## Enable SSPR

Now, you're ready to enable SSPR for the group.

1. In your Microsoft Entra organization, under **Manage**, select **Password reset**.
1. On the **Properties** page, select **Selected**. Select the link under **Select Group**, select the box next to the **SSPRTesters** group, and then the **Select** button.
1. Select **Save**.

1. Select **Customization**.
1. Select **Yes**, and then in the **Custom helpdesk email or URL** text box, enter **admin@organization-domain-name.onmicrosoft.com**. Replace "organization-domain-name" with the domain name of the Microsoft Entra organization you created. If you've forgotten the domain name, hover over your profile in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Save**.

## Register for SSPR

Now that the SSPR configuration is complete, register an email for the user you created.
