Suppose you're an IT administrator for a large retail organization. Your organization starts using Microsoft Entra ID to allow employees to securely sign in and use software as a service (SaaS) apps. It also allows access to the organization's resources in Microsoft 365. You're overwhelmed with password-reset requests because you currently reset employees' passwords manually. To get these employees back to being productive quickly and reduce your workload, you decide to evaluate and set up self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID.

In this module, you learn how Azure supports this feature and how to set it up. Only paid subscriptions can leverage this, while free and pay-as-you-go can't.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to configure self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID.
