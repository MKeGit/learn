Suppose you're an IT administrator for a large retail organization. Your organization has started using Microsoft Entra ID to allow employees to securely sign in and use software as a service (SaaS) apps and access the organization's resources in Microsoft 365. You're overwhelmed with password-reset requests, because you currently reset employees' passwords manually. To get these employees back to being productive quickly and reduce your workload, you decide to evaluate and set up self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID.
