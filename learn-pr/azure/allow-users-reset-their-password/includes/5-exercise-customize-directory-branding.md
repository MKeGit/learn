Suppose you've been asked to display your retail organization's branding on the Azure sign-in page to reassure users that they're passing credentials to a legitimate system.

Here, you'll learn how to configure this custom branding.

To complete this exercise, you must have two image files:

- A page background image. This must be a PNG or JPG file, 1920 x 1080 pixels, and smaller than 300 KB.
- A company logo image. This must be a PNG or JPG file, 32 x 32 pixels, and smaller than 5 KB.
