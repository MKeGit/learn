We've reviewed the three core ideas behind finding a good use-case fit for Autonomous AI. Here's a list of situations that also constitute good candidates to use Machine Teaching for Autonomous AI:

- Existing control systems are fragile when deployed.
- Machine Learning logic doesn't adequately cover all scenarios.
- Describing the desired system behavior requires subject matter experts who understand the problem domain.
- Generating sufficient real-world data to cover all scenarios is difficult or impossible.
- Traditional control systems are difficult to deploy and scale to the real world.

Machine Teaching bridges Data Science with traditional engineering and domain expertise.

Example applications include:

- Motion control
- Machine calibration
- Smart buildings
- Industrial robotics
- Process control

Most manufacturing scenarios fall into one of the four categories in the following diagram. The Y-axis goes from the state of the environment that's easy to assess (bottom) to the state that's difficult to assess (top). The X-axis goes from the easy decision about which action to take to make (left) to the decision that's difficult to make (right). In the leftâ€“top quadrant (green) we have the challenges solved using supervised learning plus a prescriptive rule: predictive maintenance. In the bottom-left quadrant, we have the challenges that are suited to be solved using control theory: machine control for predictable scenarios. On the right-side quadrants, we have the set of challenges that are a good fit to be solved using Deep Reinforcement Learning: production scheduling, baggage handling optimization, bulldozer blade control, oil vertical drilling, proactive maintenance, vision-based drone flight, and so on.

The preceding diagram shows division of manufacturing use cases (X axes: how difficult the decision on the next action is to make; Y axes: how difficult the state of the environment is to assess).
