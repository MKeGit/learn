Deploying applications to the cloud can be a complex undertaking. Your app can consist of many layers, different endpoints, and storage options. Maintaining the app once live can also be a challenge.

## Example scenario: App with microservices

Suppose you are the head of engineering at a travel company that offers a wide range of travel services that include flights, vacation packages, hotel accommodation and car rentals. The company has a complex system to manage bookings and payments, and a large customer base.

As engineering lead, you must do research on and build multiple microservices, which may be complex to implement and deploy for each service. Microservices in this travel company include:

- Customer service: to manage communication with all customers.
- A Flight booking service: to manage flight bookings from customers.
- A Car rental service: to manage customer rental bookings.
- A Hotel booking service: to manage hotel bookings from customers.
- A Payment service: to manage all customer transactions.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create a Code to Cloud instance and seamlessly deploy your microservices without dealing with individual deployment complexities.
