  questions:
  - content: "Which method do we recommended for authenticating to Azure Database for PostgreSQL to enhance security?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using connection strings with embedded credentials"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using connection strings with embedded credentials can expose sensitive information and is less secure."
    - content: "Using Microsoft Entra ID and a managed identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using Microsoft Entra ID and a managed identity enhances security by avoiding the use of embedded credentials and using the identity management capabilities in Azure."
  - content: "What is the benefit of using a managed identity for accessing Azure Database for PostgreSQL from a virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "It eliminates the need for storing credentials in the application code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A managed identity allows secure access to Azure resources without the need to store credentials in the application code."
    - content: "It provides faster query execution times."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A managed identity is primarily a security feature and does not directly impact query execution times."
  - content: "What role should be assigned to a user to allow them to administer a virtual machine in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual Machine Administrator Login"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The Virtual Machine Administrator Login role allows a user to administer a virtual machine in Azure."
    - content: "Reader"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Reader role only allows viewing resources and does not provide administrative access."
  - content: "How can you secure network access to an Azure virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "By configuring network security group (NSG) rules"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Network security group (NSG) rules allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from an Azure virtual machine."
    - content: "By disabling all network interfaces"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Disabling all network interfaces would make the virtual machine inaccessible and is not a practical security measure."
