  questions:
  - content: "Which method is recommended for authenticating to Azure Database for PostgreSQL to enhance security?"
    choices:
    - content: "Using connection strings with embedded credentials"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using connection strings with embedded credentials can expose sensitive information and is less secure."
    - content: "Using Microsoft Entra ID and Managed Identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Using Microsoft Entra ID and Managed Identity enhances security by avoiding the use of embedded credentials and leveraging Azure's identity management capabilities."
    - content: "Using a shared username and password"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Using a shared username and password can expose sensitive information and is less secure."
  - content: "What is the benefit of using a Managed Identity for accessing Azure Database for PostgreSQL from a Virtual Machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "It eliminates the need for storing credentials in the application code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Managed Identity allows secure access to Azure resources without the need to store credentials in the application code."
    - content: "It provides faster query execution times."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Managed Identity is primarily a security feature and does not directly impact query execution times."
    - content: "It allows access to the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Managed Identity is primarily a security feature and does not provide access to the Azure portal."
  - content: "What role should be assigned to a user to allow them to administer a Virtual Machine in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Virtual Machine Administrator Login"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The 'Virtual Machine Administrator Login' role allows a user to administer a Virtual Machine in Azure."
    - content: "Reader"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The 'Reader' role only allows viewing resources and does not provide administrative access."
    - content: "Contributor"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The 'Contributor' role allows managing resources but does not provide specific Virtual Machine administration capabilities."
  - content: "How can you secure network access to an Azure Virtual Machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "By adding a load balancer without any additional configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adding a load balancer without any additional configuration does not enhance security and can expose the Virtual Machine to potential threats."
    - content: "By configuring Network Security Group (NSG) rules"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Network Security Group (NSG) rules allow you to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from an Azure Virtual Machine."
    - content: "By disabling all network interfaces"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Disabling all network interfaces would make the Virtual Machine inaccessible and is not a practical security measure."
