You wanted to migrate Linux and PostgreSQL workloads from an on-premises or cloud solution to Azure. In this module, you deployed Linux and PostgreSQL infrastructure and then configured the Linux application workload. You then ran a sample app with sample data and explored the deployment.

This migration allows for improvements in:

- Security and compliance.
- The security of connections between your virtual machines and databases.
- Access to high-performance and cost-effective compute across multiple regions.
- Cost management and cost-effectiveness.
- Day 2 operations.

There are cost and security considerations for businesses that are migrating to right-sized workloads in Azure. This module introduced you to several tools that can help you explore those considerations.
