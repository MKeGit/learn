Recall that in the storm events example, you've narrowed down events by time range, keywords, and values in a particular column. You've also sorted results and projected specific columns.

Now, try writing a query from scratch. Use the **StormEvents** table to answer the following question:

In the month of April 2007, what were the top five damage-causing storm events in the state of Virginia? In this case, "damage" refers to both property and crop damage.

Use the operators `where`, `project`, and `top`.
