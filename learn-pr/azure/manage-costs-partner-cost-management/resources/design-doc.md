## Outline the units

*Add more units as needed for your content*

1. **Introduction**

    You are an admin agent or billing admin for Fabrikam, a CSP partner who consults with law firms to provide solutions for them to move their infrastructure presence to the cloud. You have begun receiving bills and want to use Cost Management to better understand, manage, and optimize your costs to ensure that they are kept in line. Your CEO expressed concern about the bill last month, which was $15 K larger than the previous month. He has asked you to analyze your company’s customers and resources to determine the primary cost drivers on your bill.  You also are interested in maximizing the Partner Earned Credits (PEC) that Fabrikam receives by identifying the resources across your customers that do not have the credit applied.

    One of your firms, Contoso, also reached out to you this week and wants to set budgets and thresholds that can turn down and automate actions on VMs when certain cost thresholds are exceeded. You decide to enable cost management for them to enable them to set budgets and manage costs at pay as you go retail rates. 

    Notes from review: 

    Consider making more specific, what might be happening to the person and how would they solve the specific problem? 

    Ex: You had a customer who accused you of overcharging and you want to be able to show them the Azure costs as proof. 

    Ex: you run a business that handles the infra for x, y, z. You are hired to do x, run your software off of Azure, etc.
