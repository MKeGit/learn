SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is an adaptable and easy-to-manage platform that allows developers and administrators to deploy business-critical workloads on-premises, in the cloud and at the edge. It's optimized for performance, security, and reliability. Since 2009, SUSE and Microsoft have been working together to provide unique, codeveloped, Azure-optimized solutions for SUSE SLES. 

## Example scenario
Imagine you work for a startup retailer that wants to create a website, and your current assignment is to set up a LAMP stack (Linux OS, Apache webserver, MySQL database, PHP programming) using SUSE SLES on Azure.

## What will we be doing?
Through the course of this module, we discuss two tools that are unique to SUSE and how you can use them to add packages to your SUSE SLES VM on Azure.

## What is the main goal?
By the end of this module, you're able to deploy a SUSE Linux VM on Azure, install packages with YaST, and reconcile dependencies with zypper.
