As the pace of cloud adoption accelerates, customers are increasingly dependent on highly performant storage for their latency-sensitive cloud-based workloads.

## Premium Blob Storage benefits for latency-sensitive cloud-based workloads

Premium Blob Storage is an optimal solution in latency-sensitive scenarios because it enhances the responsiveness of systems that provide the following functionality:

- Interactive editing

- Data visualization

- E-commerce applications

- Interactive analytics

- Real-time streaming analytics

- Internet of things (IoT) telemetry collection and processing

- Data processing pipelines

- Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)

- Applications needing fast data transfer

In particular, highly interactive and real-time applications benefit from minimized data access latencies. E-commerce applications are typically expected to provide instant updates based on user feedback. Similarly, interactive video editing or multiplayer online gaming applications rely on the ability to accommodate real-time updates to optimize user experience.

## IoT scenarios

In an IoT scenario, it's common to expect a high volume of small-size write operations that are streamed to cloud-based storage. Such data is often subject to additional processing for analytical purposes and deleted shortly afterwards. These types of workloads, along with real-time streaming and data processing pipelines can take advantage of the high ingestion capabilities of premium block blob storage.

## AI and ML scenarios

AI and ML inferencing and Azure AI services rely on the ability to consume and process visuals, speech, and text in near-real time. Minimized latency of storage access is essential in such cases to provide a rapid response by reducing the time it takes to ingest and analyze data.
