In this module, you learned how to identify optimal types of Azure Stack HCI workloads and plan for their implementation. You also learned how to deploy Azure Stack HCI, verify its operational status, and identify options for integrating it with Azure services.

Using this knowledge, you decided that Azure Stack HCI is the most suitable solution for Contoso, and identified resource requirements for its workloads by reviewing performance utilization of existing SQL Server deployments and estimating the projected number and type of VDI users. That information formed the basis for selecting properly sized hardware from the Azure Stack HCI Catalog. To validate the deployment, Contoso ran functional and performance tests, leveraging Windows Admin Center and synthetic workloads generated by VM Fleet. To further optimize its deployment, Contoso integrated Azure Stack HCI clusters and their workloads with several cloud-based services that Contoso had previously implemented in its Azure subscriptions.
