The key to the success of an application lies in its user interface. It's the first link between your system and the user; creating a robust user interface will influence the other users who need your application. 

Let's suppose you're working at a tech company in the UI/UX designing team. Your company is planning to launch a holographic application. Your job is to improve the application's user experience (UX) by providing components that will assist the user in better interaction with holograms.

This module shows you how to build a mixed reality user experience with MRTK using NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover hologram model. Here, you'll:

* Create a basic user interface using MRTK's button and menu prefabs.
* Add bounds control around 3D objects

By the end of the module, you can create and edit UI elements for your project using MRTK.
