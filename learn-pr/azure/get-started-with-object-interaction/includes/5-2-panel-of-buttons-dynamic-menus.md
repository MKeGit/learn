## UI buttons

Buttons help the user to trigger an immediate action. It's one of the foundational components provided by MRTK. Various kinds of button prefabs can be used, depending on your situation. The Button is based on the StatefulInteractable script component to offer smooth UI controls on different interactive surfaces. The StatefulInteractable component is an all-in-one box to make any item interactable. StatefulInteractable acts as a catch-all, considering all forms of entering consisting of touch, hand rays, speech, and so on, and funnels those interactions into activities and visible subject responses.

## UI menu

Menu is a UX control, which offers a set of buttons or different UI components. It's floating across the user's frame and effortlessly available anytime. Since it's loosely coupled with the person, it no longer disturbs the user's interplay with the target content. The user can use the 'Pin' button to world-lock/unlock the menu. The menu may be grabbed at a selected position and relocated to a selected position.
