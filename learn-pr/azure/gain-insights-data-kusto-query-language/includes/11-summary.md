Your goal was to use advanced Kusto queries and visualizations to answer questions about the kinds and locations of storms in the US. In particular, you wanted to compare the impacts of different types of storms in various locations.

You started with some simple queries and progressively modified them to produce more advanced queries, as follows:

* You first used the `count()`, `dcount()`, and `countif()` functions to gain insights into the extent of damage per event type in each location.
* You then visualized the results using `render`, `bin()`, and `sum()`, which can be a helpful aid in comparing activity across location.
* You used the `avg()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `percentiles()` functions to gain further insights into your data.
* Finally, you learned how to create variables and functions with the `let` statement, making it easier to write well-organized, readable queries.

Kusto queries made it easier to gain insights into your data. The powerful operators and functions made complex queries easier to write and understand. You can now analyze your data in a more meaningful way.
