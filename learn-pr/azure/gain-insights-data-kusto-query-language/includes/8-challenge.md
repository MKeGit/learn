Recall that in the storm events, you've used aggregation functions to compare different groups of information. You've organized complex queries with `let` statements. Finally, you've presented this data in graphical format.

Now, it's your turn to try writing a query from scratch.

Use the table we've been exploring up until now, *StormEvents*, to answer the following question:

What was the total week-by-week damage caused by all flood events? Show damage in the unit of Euros. In this case, damage refers to both property and crop damage. Assume the Euro is worth 1.14 USD.

Use `summarize`, `sum`, `render`, `bin`, and `let`.
