We've used a meteorological dataset to aggregate and compare the number of certain kinds of storm events in different US states for the year 2007. Here, you'll visualize these results with the aid of time-binned graphs.

## Use the `render` operator

Recall that you've used the `summarize` operator to group events by a common field such as *State*. In the previous unit, you used different versions of the `count` operator to compare the number and types of events by state. Visualizing these results can be a helpful aid in comparing activity across states.

To visualize results, you'll use the `render` operator. This operator comes at the end of a query. Within the `render` operator, you'll specify which type of visualization to use, such as `columnchart`, `barchart`, `piechart`, `scatterchart`, `pivotchart`, and others. You can also optionally define different properties of the visualization, such as the x-axis or y-axis.

In this example, you'll visualize the previous query using a bar chart.

1. Run the following query.

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAy2NOQ6DQAxFe07hEqQUuQA0JCcAKWVkwAlTzBh5PEggDs9i3P33FzfK4t8zBY3ZBjF5j+JWgp5T0Lx4ZHCc+R+n4ws9/qnlWniKUFrM/XLjRit43r3BVq56u0xUQLdAo6h0/mLRU1+Z7wGEwkACHUo/ougOiZ2Ja5oAAAA=" target="_blank">Run the query</a>

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | summarize count(),
        EventsWithDamageToCrops = countif(DamageCrops > 0),
        dcount(EventType) by State
    | sort by count_
    | render barchart
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-column-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of query with bar chart results." lightbox="../media/5-column-chart.png":::

1. Notice the legend to the right of the bar chart. Each value in the legend represents a different column of data that's been summarized by *State* in the query. Try selecting one of the values, such as *count_*, to toggle displaying this data in the bar chart. By toggling off *count_*, you remove the total count and are left with count of events that caused damage and distinct number of events. You should get a graph that looks like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-column-chart-toggle.png" alt-text="Screenshot of column chart results with count_ field toggled off." lightbox="../media/5-column-chart-toggle.png":::

1. Take a look at the resulting bar chart. What insights can you gain from this? You might notice, for example, that Texas had the most individual storm events, but Iowa had the highest incidence of damaging storm events.

## Group values using the `bin()` function

Until now, you've used aggregation functions to group events by *State*. Let's now look at the distribution of storms throughout the year, by grouping data by time. The time values we have in every record are the start time and end time. Let's group the event start times by week, so we can see how many storms happened each week during the year 2007.

You'll use the `bin()` function, which groups values into set intervals. For example, you might have data from every day of the year, and you'd like to group these dates by week. Or, you want to group population data by age bins. The syntax of this operator is:

> `bin(`*value*`,`*roundTo*`)`

The bin value can be a number, date, or timespan. You'll aggregate the count using the `bin()` function to give you a count of events per week. The *value* you want to group is the *StartTime* of the storm event, with the *roundTo* bin size of *7days* or *7d* for short. Finally, *render* the data as a *columnchart* to create a histogram.

1. Run the following query:

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwsuyS/KdS1LzSsp5qpRKC7NzU0syqxKVUjOL80r0dBUSKpUSMrM0wguSSwqCcnMTdVRME/RBKosSs1LSS0CKsspzc1LzgDKAgAcJKS1SgAAAA==" target="_blank">Run the query</a>

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | summarize count() by bin(StartTime, 7d)
    | render columnchart
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-bin-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of binned results graph.":::

1. Take a look at the resulting histogram. Hover over one of the bars to see the bin start time (x-value) and event count (y-value).

## Use the `sum` operator

In the previous query, you looked at the number of storm events over time. Now let's take a look at the damage these storms caused. For this, you'll use the `sum` aggregation function, because you want to see the total amount of damage caused in each time interval. The dataset you're working with has two columns related to damage: *DamageProperty* and *DamageCrops*.

In the following query, you'll first create a calculated column that adds these two damage sources together. Then, you'll create an aggregation of total damage binned by week. Finally, you'll render a column chart representing the weekly damage caused by all storms.

1. Run the following query:

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAy2MwQ5EQBBE7/sVdSTcnZysu4QfGKZjJ9Ez0pog+/E72Fvl1atqNQjXG3ldXl/QruQtrGEzEkq879BImEn0QPYHVQSXvqzMRtxJV0qeVYr+QO980qoR7RxTjsKm0ZZ4TYIhTCv74RPbH8PaQ9t9AAAA" target="_blank">Run the query</a>

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | extend damage = DamageProperty + DamageCrops
    | summarize sum(damage) by bin(StartTime, 7d)
    | render columnchart
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-bin-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of damage column chart binned by week.":::

1. The previous query shows you damage as a function of time. Another way to compare the damage is by event type. Run the following query to use a pie chart to compare the damages caused by different event types.

    <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/Samples?query=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwsuyS/KdS1LzSsp5qpRSK0oSc1LUUhJzE1MT1WwVXABMwKK8gtSi0oqFbShAs5AAZDy4tLc3MSizKpUEEsDoktTIalSAWxgSGVBKlBREdDE1CKFgszU5IzEohIAomCsu3EAAAA=" target="_blank">Run the query</a>

    ```kusto
    StormEvents
    | extend damage = DamageProperty + DamageCrops
    | summarize sum(damage) by EventType
    | render piechart
    ```

    You should get results that look like the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/5-pie-chart.png" alt-text="Screen shot of Kusto query with pie chart and results.":::

1. Hover over one of the slices of the pie chart. You should see the absolute value (total damage caused by this event type) and the corresponding percentage of the overall damage.
