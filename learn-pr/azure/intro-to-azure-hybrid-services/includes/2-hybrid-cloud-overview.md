Hybrid clouds combine private clouds and on-premises datacenters with public clouds like Azure. They allow applications and data to interact without the location of either being significant.

Hybrid clouds allow businesses to seamlessly scale up their on-premises infrastructure into the cloud when processing demand increases, and scale back that infrastructure when demand decreases. Hybrid clouds give organizations the flexibility to use new cloud-first technologies for new workloads while keeping business-critical applications and data on-premises for certain workloads. For example, some applications can be too expensive to migrate or can't be moved for compliance reasons.

A hybrid cloud strategy allows your organization to make on-premises and cloud workloads work together. Hybrid clouds shouldn't be considered a temporary middle ground that organizations inhabit only while they transition from on-premises to Azure. Instead, a hybrid cloud can be a strategy that allows organizations to find a stable middle ground that best addresses their information-technology needs.
