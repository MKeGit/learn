Many organizations that use Azure have some workloads that run on-premises in traditional datacenters or server rooms and other workloads that run completely in the cloud. An increasing number of organizations migrate all their workloads to the cloud, while some start as cloud native. 

Some organizations are either on a slower migration journey toward the cloud, or are seeking a balance between keeping some workloads on-premises and putting others in the cloud. Instead of being an all-or-nothing proposition, a properly architected hybrid Azure deployment allows these organizations to find a balance between cloud and on-premises deployments that best fits their needs.

In this module, you get an introductory overview of hybrid cloud technologies and how you can connect an on-premises environment to Azure in a way that works best for your organization.

## Scenario

Tailwind Traders is a conglomerate business that manufactures and sells hardware, outdoor maintenance equipment, electrical appliances, and furniture. Tailwind Traders is based in Australia and New Zealand. The head office is in Sydney. Branch offices are in Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, and Auckland. 

There are major datacenters in Sydney and Melbourne and a minor datacenter in Auckland. In addition, 100 retail sites are scattered across both Australia and New Zealand. These sites have registers and other computers that use VPN connections to interact with applications running in these datacenters.

The IT infrastructure of Tailwind Traders grew piecemeal since the 1990s. About 25 percent of business-critical applications are still running on physical servers, 60 percent run on virtual machines, and the remaining 15 percent were migrated to containers. Many of the noncontainerized applications rely heavily on on-premises Active Directory Domain Services for identity and security configuration through Group Policy.

The Melbourne datacenter functions as a disaster-recovery site for the Sydney and Auckland datacenters. The Sydney datacenter functions as a disaster-recovery site for the Melbourne datacenter.

Tailwind Traders uses site-to-site VPNs to connect the retail and Auckland sites to the Sydney office. There's a dedicated leased connection between the Sydney and Melbourne datacenters. Internal network traffic between branch offices is all routed through Sydney in a hub-and-spoke architecture.

Tailwind Traders wants to rationalize its datacenter footprint. The organization plans to migrate workloads to Azure where it makes sense, and keep the workloads on-premises that can't be easily migrated for technical or cost reasons. The chief information officer (CIO) at Tailwind Traders calls the company's hybrid cloud strategy "Best of Both Worlds."
