  questions:

  - content: "As a part of its hybrid strategy, Tailwind Traders wants to manage container orchestration through the Azure portal instead of using on-premises tools. Which of the following compute technologies for hybrid clouds allows Tailwind Traders to accomplish this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is a container orchestration service that allows you to manage container orchestration through the Azure portal."
    - content: "Azure Stack HCI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Stack HCI is an on-premises hyperconverged virtualization host solution. Although it's possible to host a container orchestration solution on those virtual machines, Azure Stack HCI isn't a container orchestration solution."
    - content: "Azure Arc enabled servers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc enabled servers are servers that exist outside the Azure IaaS environment and are connected to Azure, and for which Azure can provide some limited management functionality."


  - content: "As a part of its hybrid cloud strategy, Tailwind Traders wants to occasionally burst the calculations that it performs on its high-performance compute cluster onto a series of temporary Azure virtual machines. Which of the following technologies can the company use to manage this process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Arc enabled servers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc enabled servers allow you to perform certain management tasks against on-premises servers. They don't allow you to manage high-performance computing tasks and burst those tasks into Azure."
    - content: "Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes allows you to manage container orchestration in hybrid environments."
    - content: "Hybrid HPC"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Hybrid HPC allows an organization to burst high-performance computing workloads onto temporary Azure virtual machines."
