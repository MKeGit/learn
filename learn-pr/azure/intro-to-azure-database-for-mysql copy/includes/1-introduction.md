Most cloud architects and developers don't want to manage the server that hosts their apps or the underlying operating system (OS) and database. Instead, they want to focus on developing their cloud-designed apps. Using Microsoft Azure Database for MySQL can help them achieve this focus.

Azure Database for MySQL is a managed relational database as a service (DBaaS) offering that can help manage your mission-critical workloads with predictable performance and dynamic scalability. You can connect your existing client apps and database tools to your instance of Azure Database for MySQL to gain the benefits of a platform as a service (PaaS) environment, as shown in the following image.

By implementing Azure Database for MySQL, you can take advantage of high availability, data protection, and predictable, scalable performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Database for MySQL is based on the MySQL Community Edition database engine versions 5.7 and 8.0.

> [!TIP]
> Azure Database for MySQL now supports [in-place upgrades to major versions](/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-upgrade). For example, if you have a MySQL 5.7 server, you can upgrade it to MySQL 8.0 without any data movement or needing to update application connection strings.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at an organization implementing MySQL databases to support critical workloads. Your company's cloud architects and developers spend considerable time managing servers. They also frequently troubleshoot issues with the operating systems and databases. You want to migrate to Azure Database for MySQL to take advantage of the following benefits:

- High availability
- Automatic backups
- Automated maintenance
- Improved compliance and security
- Dynamic scalability

By migrating to Azure Database for MySQL, you can help your cloud architects and developers focus on app development and on delivering those apps and data to your users.

## What you will do

During this module, you will evaluate the capabilities of Azure Database for MySQL so that you can determine whether it's a good choice to help manage your workloads. To do this evaluation, you'll:

- Identify the Azure Database for MySQL features.
- Assess whether Azure Database for MySQL can help address your organization's database requirements.
- Determine which MySQL deployment option on Azure is best for your organization.

## Primary goal

The primary goal of this module is to enable you to determine whether Azure Database for MySQL is appropriate for managing your organization's workloads. You should also be able to describe how Azure Database for MySQL performance and scalability makes it ideal for hosting your database workloads.
