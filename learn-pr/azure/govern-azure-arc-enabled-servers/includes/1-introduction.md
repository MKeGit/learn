Azure Arc bridges the gap between on-premises and cloud environments. Azure Arc provides a consistent operational approach with the agility, automation, and scalability of the Azure platform and its services. In this module, you learn about the governance and configuration capabilities of Azure Arc-enabled servers.

Suppose you’re an IT director at Fabrikam Residences, a large rental agency specializing in single-family homes, with a large rental inventory application. As your company invests in its hybrid and multicloud environment, it onboarded its non-Azure machines to Azure Arc-enabled servers. One challenge you face, is the management of servers and virtual machines across your sprawling IT infrastructure. For much of your infrastructure, you want to point, click, set, and forget. For other assets, you have interest in higher granularity from an inventory management, change tracking, and patching perspective. Across your heterogeneous compute, you want to apply sets of policies and baselines with visibility into compliance.

Through Azure Arc-enabled servers, you can use Azure’s robust governance plane through Azure Policy, Azure Automanage, and Azure Automation to deliver a consistent, scalable, and manageable configuration plane across your hybrid environment. The same governance you have into Azure resources, you can extend to your resources sitting outside of Azure.
