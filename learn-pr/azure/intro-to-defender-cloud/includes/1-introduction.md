Ensuring your online business maintains the highest level security posture is paramount to ensure it's protected from cybersecurity threats. To be successful, businesses are becoming reliant on multicloud environments to handle the day to day operations of their basic system's infrastructure and information. Businesses need to be alerted about potential and actual cyber-attacks as soon as they occur. With this knowledge, they'll have the best possible chance to protect themselves and prevent future attacks.

Suppose you work for Contoso, an online clothing retailer that is developing a new e-commerce website to sell its clothes. Contoso's new website is made up of several parts, which are hosted in a multicloud environment that consists of Microsoft's Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). There are backend Linux servers that are used to run the website's application. The website also requires SQL databases to store data.

Contoso's website needs to ensure that its servers and data are secure. Defender for Cloud offers various plans that ensure the proper defensive measures are in place for multicloud environments. For example, to protect the company's website, Constoso would want to enable Defender for Cloud with both the Defender for Servers plan and the Defender for SQL plans enabled.

Some of the protections that are provided include:

| Type of protections | Benefits |
