Most organizations have diverse requirements for their cloud-hosted data. Data often is different types and sizes, and no single storage solution meets all requirements. Suppose you work for a medium-sized financial services company. Your Chief Technology Officer (CTO) wants to migrate several applications, databases, and support files to the cloud. This migration reduces the number of physical servers that your company maintains in its datacenter. As part of your migration strategy, you must determine a suitable approach for your cloud-based storage infrastructure.

A primary concern in a migration strategy is how to move enterprise applications like SAP HANA (High-performance Analytic Appliance) and many SQL databases, which require high-performance storage. Some application workloads run periodic batch jobs. Batch jobs demand high performance for short periods, but most of the time, they have baseline performance.

You must evaluate Azure Disk Storage types and capabilities and propose a storage solution that optimizes performance and costs for applications that require high-performance storage.
