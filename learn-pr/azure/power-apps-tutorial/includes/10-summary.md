In this module, you learned how to design and develop an application in a short period of time without the need for any coding. Users with any level of knowledge can use the apps for business purposes. By using the Microsoft Cloud and services like Dynamics 365, Power Apps lets you access work across the Web and mobile without the time and expense of custom software development.

## Next steps

* Use different **Connectors**.
* Add functionality that lets the user order more than one product.
* Incorporate **View shape in MR**.
