Your team at the community bank completed sprint 3 for the new deposits application. During the sprint, the deposits team requested infrastructure changes including modifying resource properties, adding new and existing resource, and detaching and deleting resources from the deployment stack. Your team gained an understanding of how resources are managed by a deployment stack.

In this module, you learned about managed resources and the  _action on unmanage_ parameter which is used to control how Azure handles detached resources, resource groups, and management groups. You modified the properties of an Azure resource managed by a deployment stack, added an existing resource to the stack, and added a new resource to the stack.

You then detached and deleted resources from a deployment stack. Finally, you deleted the deployment stack and its managed resources.
