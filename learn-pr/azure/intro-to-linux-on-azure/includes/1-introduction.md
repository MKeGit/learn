Suppose you're an experienced Linux admin who is tasked with deploying a new Linux environment on Azure. You know you need to understand the tradeoffs between the two major approaches (IaaS and PaaS) and the different ways you can deploy within each approach. You also want to understand how to select a Linux distribution, decide on a subscription model, and identify the most appropriate supporting Azure services for your needs.

In this module, you'll learn about the types of services and platforms that Azure provides for Linux environments. Whether you're exploring the migration of Linux-based workloads to the cloud, or you're looking at rearchitecting your Linux-based applications to increase agility and reduce time to market, after completing this module you should be able to choose which types of services you'll need to start planning your Linux environment on Azure.
