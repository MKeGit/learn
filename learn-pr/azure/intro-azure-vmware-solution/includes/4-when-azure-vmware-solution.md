Each organization's cloud transformation is unique and based on its own requirements. Azure VMware Solution provides a fast path to adopt the cloud, without the need to reformat existing assets to work in the new cloud environment. The solution removes that extra work by enabling you to run your VMware technology stack on Azure as if it's on-premises. There's no need for app refactoring or extra skills.

Organizations are using Azure VMware Solution in many ways to extend the value of their existing investments while getting started with the cloud. With Azure VMware Solution, you can run your VMware environment on Azure dedicated infrastructure.

Let's discuss the scenarios best suited for Azure VMware Solution. The following table describes business needs and considerations where Azure VMware Solution might be a good choice for an organization.


|Business need  |  Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Migrate existing assets "as is"    |Take the fast path to the cloud. Replicate existing IT systems, apps, and workloads natively in Azure (also known as a "lift and shift" migration) without needing to change them beforehand.    | 
|Reduce your datacenter footprint     | If your enterprise wants to leave the datacenter business, you can use Azure as a way to enable decommissioning legacy infrastructure, after you bring your resources into the cloud.   |
|Prepare for disaster recovery and business continuity     |Move your apps to the cloud without disruption to your business. You can also deploy VMware resources on Azure for a primary or secondary on-demand recovery site to provide business continuity for your existing on-premises datacenter resources.      |
|Modernize your workloads   |  Provide a future path to innovate and expand on the value of cloud investments. At your speed and pace, take advantage of Azure tools and services to modernize your datacenter and applications. |

Azure VMware Solution isn't suited for organizations that want to stay on-premises. Enterprises that don't want to use the cloud shouldn't consider Azure VMware Solution.
