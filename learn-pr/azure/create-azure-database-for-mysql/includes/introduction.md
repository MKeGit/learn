Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed, scalable service provided by Azure that is designed to simplify how you deploy, manage, and scale your MySQL databases. This service is fully compatible with your existing MySQL-based applications.

## Example scenario

Imagine you're a developer at a large financial services company, using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack to develop a web-based application. Currently, your application's proof-of-concept uses an on-premises MySQL server. As the project moves toward a pilot phase in several branch offices, you foresee that the existing server won't be able to handle the anticipated high transaction volume. You also have concerns about the resilience of your current setup.

To tackle these challenges, you're looking at leveraging cloud solutions and specifically considering deploying your MySQL database on Microsoft Azure. You prefer to focus more on your programming rather than managing infrastructure, so you're inclined to explore Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server—a managed service—over managing MySQL on Azure VMs.

## What you will do

In this module, you start by exploring the core functionality of Azure Database for MySQL. Then, you use your newly acquired knowledge to set up an instance of Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server and connect to it.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you should know how to successfully create and connect to an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server, empowering you to enhance the scalability, performance, and resilience of your application with minimal management overhead. As a result, you'll be able to focus more on development and less on operational complexities, optimizing both your time and resources.
