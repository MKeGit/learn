Azure Database for MySQL—Flexible Server is a fully managed, scalable service provided by Azure designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of MySQL databases. This service is fully compatible with existing MySQL-based applications.

## Example scenario

Imagine you're a large financial services company developer, using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack to develop a web-based application. Currently, your application's proof-of-concept uses an on-premises MySQL server. As the project moves toward a pilot phase in several branch offices, you foresee that the existing server can't handle the anticipated high transaction volume. You also have concerns about the resilience of your current setup.

To tackle these challenges, you're looking at leveraging cloud solutions and specifically considering deploying your MySQL database on Microsoft Azure. You prefer to focus more on your programming than managing infrastructure, so you're inclined to explore Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server—a managed service—over managing MySQL on Azure VMs.
