Deploying Elastic on Azure VMs provides a high level of flexibility and control of the underlying infrastructure. The Elasticsearch (self-managed) template available in the Azure Marketplace offers a way to get started quickly using best practices.

Recall that the start-up retailer you work for currently uses Elastic on-premises to manage sales transactions. They would like to migrate to Azure VMs to improve data accessibility for remote workers and other departments while reducing the burden of maintaining infrastructure. Here, you go through the steps for deploying an Elastic workload on Azure VMs.

1. From the Azure Marketplace, search for and choose the Elasticsearch (self-managed) template.
