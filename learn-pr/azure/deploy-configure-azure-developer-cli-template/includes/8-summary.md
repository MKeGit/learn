The goal of this module was to learn how to deploy Azure Developer CLI templates and use different commands to accomplish common development tasks. We worked through the following tasks and features:

* Installed and setup the Azure Developer CLI locally.
* Selected and deployed an `azd` template.
* Redeployed and provisioned template updates to the Azure environment.
* Learned how to monitor the hosted application using Application Insights dashboards.
* Configured a CI/CD pipeline as another option to push updates to Azure.
* Disposed of resources that are no longer used.

These are all common tasks when working with `azd` and provide an introduction to how the tool is used in practice. `azd` can provide significant value to most apps that require streamlined provisioning and deployment to Azure in a repeatable, distributable format.
