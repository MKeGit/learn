We've taken a look at several features you can use to put organization and control around your Azure resources.

- We described how resource groups worked and some ways you can use them to organize your resources.
- We looked at how tags let you add custom contextual information to your resources for use in areas such as billing and filtering.
- We saw how you could use policies to enforce standards across our Azure resources.
- We used resource locks to prevent accidental deletion of critical resources.

By using these tools throughout your Azure environment, you'll have greater organization across your Azure resources.
