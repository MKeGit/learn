Now that you've reviewed the deployment and connectivity options associated with Azure Database for MySQL â€“ Flexible Server, it's time to test the process of provisioning a server and validating its availability by connecting to it. In this unit, you step through a sample deployment and connect to the flexible server using the mysql.exe utility from the Azure Cloud Shell.

### Deploy an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server

To deploy an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server from the Azure portal, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Azure portal for the sandbox.

4. On the **Flexible server** page, on the **Basics** tab, enter the information in the following table.

   | **Setting** | **Value** | **Description** |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Subscription** | Concierge Subscription | The name of your subscription. In this case, we're using the *Concierge Subscription*. |
   | **Resource group** | <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> | Use the LEARN created resource group available. |
   | **Server name** | <server_name> | A valid and globally unique name that identifies your flexible server. The server's fully qualified name consists of the <server_name> you choose, followed by the suffix mysql.database.azure.com. The server name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the hyphen (-) character. It must contain between 3 and 63 characters. |
   | **Region** | The name of an Azure region | The name of the Azure region that hosts your server. Select any region that supports Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server deployment that is nearest the location of the computer you use to run this exercise. |
   | **MySQL version** | 8.0 | The MySQL major version your app uses. |
   | **Workload type** | For development or hobby projects | The intended workload type determines the virtual machine (VM) SKU to host the server. |
   | **Availability zone** | No preference | This setting allows you to specify an availability zone where the servers are deployed. Your choice is typically based on the zone hosting the application tier. |
   | **Enable high availability** | Not selected | This setting determines whether you want a replica server automatically provisioned in another availability zone (for zonal deployments). This option requires the choice of either **General Purpose** or **Business Critical** VM SKUs compute tier. |
   | **Authentication method** | MySQL authentication only | Authenticate with the admin username and password only. |
   | **Admin username** | mysqladmin | A valid username you configure as the admin account for the MySQL server instance. In this case, we're using *mysqladmin*. Don't use azure_superuser, admin, administrator, root, guest, or public. |
   | **Password** | `<Pword>` | A valid password assigned to the admin account. In this case, we're using `<Pword>`. It must contain between 8 and 128 characters and include characters from three categories: English uppercase letters, English lowercase letters, numbers (0 through 9), and nonalphanumeric characters (such as ! $, #, %). |
