You can read more in the article [Align responsibilities across teams](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/raci-alignment). 

To track decisions about organizational structure over time, you can download and modify the [RACI template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/organize/raci-template.xlsx) and customize it for your organization.
