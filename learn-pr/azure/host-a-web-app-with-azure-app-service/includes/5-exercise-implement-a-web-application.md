In this unit, you'll use developer tools to create the code for a starter web application.

## Create a new web project

::: zone pivot="csharp"

The heart of the .NET CLI tools is the `dotnet` command-line tool. Using this command, you'll create a new ASP.NET Core web project.

First, let's install the 8.0 version of `dotnet` into the Cloud Shell. For this exercise, we'll be using SDK version 3.1.102.

1. Run the following commands on the right to download and install dotnet 8.0:

    ```bash
    wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh
    chmod +x ./dotnet-install.sh
    ./dotnet-install.sh --channel 8.0
    export PATH="~/.dotnet:$PATH"
    echo "export PATH=~/.dotnet:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Next, run the following command to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC application named "BestBikeApp":

    ```bash
    dotnet new mvc --name BestBikeApp
    ```

The command will create a new folder named "BestBikeApp" to hold your project.

### Optionally test your web app

Open a second command shell session by browsing to <https://shell.azure.com/> in a new tab. You can test your application locally on Azure. To do so, use the following steps:

1. From your primary command shell session, run the following commands to build and run your web application:

    ```bash
    cd BestBikeApp
    dotnet run
    ```

    You should get output like the following:

    ```console
    warn: Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection.KeyManagement.XmlKeyManager[35]
          No XML encryptor configured. Key {b4a2970c-215c-4eb2-92b4-c28d021158c6} may be persisted to storage in unencrypted form.
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
          Now listening on: http://localhost:5022
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Hosting environment: Development
    info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
          Content root path: /home/cephas_lin/BestBikeApp
    ```

    The output describes the situation after starting your app: the application is running and listening at port 5022.

1. From another Cloud Shell session, run the following command to browse to your web application:

    ```bash
    curl -kL http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

    You should see some HTML appear, ending in the following lines:

    ```html
    <div class="text-center">
        <h1 class="display-4">Welcome</h1>
        <p>Learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core">building Web apps with ASP.NET Core</a>.</p>
    </div>
    
            </main>
        </div>
    
        <footer b-b5g3qljvtd class="border-top footer text-muted">
            <div b-b5g3qljvtd class="container">
                &copy; 2024 - BestBikeApp - <a href="/Home/Privacy">Privacy</a>
            </div>
        </footer>
        <script src="/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
        <script src="/js/site.js?v=hRQyftXiu1lLX2P9Ly9xa4gHJgLeR1uGN5qegUobtGo"></script>
        
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. From your primary command shell session, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to quit your web app.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="java"

To create a starter web application, we'll use Maven, a commonly used project-management and build tool for Java apps. We'll use the `maven-archetype-webapp` template to generate the code for our web application.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell now to create a new web app:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=example.demo -DartifactId=helloworld -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
    ```

1. Now, run these commands to change to the new "helloworld" application directory and package the application for deployment:

    ```bash
    cd helloworld
    mvn package
    ```

1. When the command finishes running, run these commands to open the *target* directory and list its content:

    ```bash
    cd target
    ls
    ```

You'll have a file listed called `helloworld.war`. This is the web application package that we'll deploy to App Service.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="node"

To create a starter Node.js web application, we'll use Node Package Manager (`npm`) along with some JavaScript code to run the actual web page processing.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to create a new `package.json` that will describe our Node.js application:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    mkdir helloworld
    cd helloworld
    npm init -y
    ```

This creates a new `package.json` file in the current folder. You should find it in the current folder if you enter `ls` in the terminal window. We'll need a JavaScript file to run our website logic. Because this is just a basic example, we'll only need one file: `index.js`.

1. Run the following command in the terminal to create the file:

    ```bash
    touch index.js
    ```

1. Now we have to make a few edits to both of our files. Run the following command in the terminal to open an interactive editor:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Select the `package.json` file and make the following edits to the `scripts` section to use Node.js to launch the web app:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "helloworld",
      ...
      "scripts": {
        "start": "node index.js"
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

1. Save the file by selecting the **...** menu, or press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Command+S</kbd> on macOS.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Whenever you edit a file in the editor, make sure to save afterwards by selecting the **...** menu in the top right corner of the editor, or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Command+S</kbd> on macOS. To exit the editor, press <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> on Windows and Linux or click the top-right corner of the editor and select **Quit** on MacOS.

1. Switch to the `index.js` file, and add the following contents to it. This is a small Node.js program that always responds with "Hello World!" when any GET request is made to the server.

    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    
    const server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {
        response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
        response.end("<html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>");
    });
    
    const port = process.env.PORT || 1337;
    server.listen(port);
    
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    ```

1. Save your file and exit the editor by selecting the **...** icon on the top right and selecting **Save** and **Close Editor** from the context menu, or by using the accelerator keys <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> on Windows and Linux.

### Optionally test your web app

While you're running the helloworld web app, you can verify it's running locally by opening a second command shell session.

1. From a new browser tab, browse to <https://shell.azure.com/>.

1. From your primary command shell session, run the following commands to start your web application:

    ```bash
    cd ~/helloworld
    npm start
    ```

1. From your second command shell session, run the following command to browse to your web application:

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/
    ```

    You should get the following output:

    ```html
    <html><body><h1>Hello World!</h1></body></html>
    ```

1. From your primary command shell session, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to quit your web app, then close the second shell session browser tab.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python"

To create a starter web application, we'll use the Flask web-application framework.

1. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to set up a virtual environment and install Flask in your profile:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install flask
    ```

1. Run these commands to create and switch to your new web app directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/BestBikeApp
    cd ~/BestBikeApp
    ```

1. Create a new file for your web app by opening *application.py* in the python interactive editor:

    ```bash
    code application.py
    ```

1. Copy and paste the following Python code to create the main web app functionality:

    ```python
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route("/")
    def hello():
        return "<html><body><h1>Hello Best Bike App!</h1></body></html>\n"
    ```

1. Save your file and exit the editor by selecting the **...** menu on the top right, and then selecting **Save** > **Close Editor**, or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> on Windows and Linux.

1. To deploy your application to Azure, you'll need to save the list of application requirements you made for it in a *requirements.txt* file. To do so, run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

### Optionally test your web app

You can test your application locally in Azure while it's running.

1. Open a second command shell session in a new browser tab  <https://shell.azure.com/>.

1. From your primary command shell session (to the right), run the following commands to activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    source venv/bin/activate
    ``` 

1. From your primary command shell session (to the right), run the following commands to start your web application:

    ```bash
    cd ~/BestBikeApp
    export FLASK_APP=application.py
    flask run
    ```

1. From your second command shell session, run the following command to browse to your web application:

    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

    You should get the following HTML output:

    ```html
    <html><body><h1>Hello Best Bike App!</h1></body></html>
    ```

1. From your primary command shell session, press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to quit your web app, then close the secondary Azure Cloud Shell.
