To support governments in their responsibilities to maintain strong data-protection requirements, Azure provides technologies to safeguard both unclassified and classified workloads in the public multitenant cloud. Data is protected at rest, in transit, and in use through a combination of residency requirements and encryption standards. Strict policies reduce the risk of unauthorized access while allowing public-sector customers the flexibility to customize services for extra protection.
