You've successfully deployed your application or service into Azure. Does the work stop there? What happens when there's a failure in production? How do you know it happened? How do you notify the right people?

An important part of the feedback loop includes collecting monitoring data from your applications and infrastructure. Doing so allows you to identify failures and then route those failures to teams who can take appropriate action.

Effective monitoring happens not only in production, but at each stage along the way. This includes your test and other pre-production environments. By catching performance and functional issues early, you can correct them before changes reach your users.

- Describe how Azure Monitor and Application Insights enable continuous monitoring on your applications and on your infrastructure.
