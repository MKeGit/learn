In this unit, we'll distinguish between the different types of server-side Java applications to help you choose a matching cloud solution.

## Monolithic applications

A monolithic application is an *all in one* solution that still fits for many projects. A monolithic application is a good start for prototyping and startups. It's simple to develop, debug, test, and deploy.

Traditionally, monolithic applications run on application servers and scale the entire application as a whole.

## Microservices

In order to succeed today, businesses are asked to adapt, fail fast, and expect the unexpected. To achieve a reduced time to market, more engineers get hired. However, the outcome might be the opposite. More engineers might result in a higher time to market, because you have more communication effort when more engineers need to collaborate. The solution here is to divide and conquer.

In a cross-functional team, you can deliver features as independently as possible. Each team should be responsible for its own dedicated part of the software.

## Batch jobs

Some applications are intended to run briefly. They execute a particular workload, then exit rather than wait for requests or user input. Batch jobs are a solution for this use case. Even though some batches can last for hours, sometimes jobs need to run once or at regular, scheduled intervals.

## Serverless architectures

Functions are executed only on an event. A function is "triggered" by a specific type of event. Supported triggers include responding to changes in data, responding to messages, running on a schedule, or receiving an HTTP request.
