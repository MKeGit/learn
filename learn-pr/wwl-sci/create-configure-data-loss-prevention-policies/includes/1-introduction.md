Your organization's data is likely one of the most important assets you're responsible for safeguarding as an administrator. The ability to build apps and automation to use that data is a large part of your company's success. You can use Power Apps and Power Automate for rapid build and rollout of these high-value apps so that users can measure and act on the data in real time.

You can use data loss prevention (DLP) policies to non-Microsoft cloud apps to monitor and detect when sensitive items are used and shared via non-Microsoft cloud apps. Using these policies provides you the visibility and control you need to ensure that they're correctly used and protected.

In this module, you learn how to discover, classify, and protect sensitive and business-critical content throughout its lifecycle. This process applies to both Power Platform and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps protected applications. You also learn to make decisions about policy priority.
