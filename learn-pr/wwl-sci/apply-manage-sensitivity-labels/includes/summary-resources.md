In our global consultancy firm, protecting sensitive information while launching a new AI-powered service is crucial. Sensitivity labels help us secure critical data, ensuring only authorized individuals have access, and enabling seamless global collaboration.

Here's what you learned:

- **Identify the function of sensitivity labels**: Described how sensitivity labels secure critical data in Microsoft 365 environments like Teams, Groups, and SharePoint Sites.
- **Apply sensitivity labels for your organization**: Demonstrated the process to enable and implement sensitivity labels across Microsoft 365 services for data protection.
- **Configure settings in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal**: Modified protection settings for groups and sites to enhance data security within your organization.

By deploying sensitivity labels throughout our Microsoft 365 environment, we maintained high data security standards during the service launch. This involved teamwork from around the world, including remote workers, ensuring client information stayed safe and teams collaborated smoothly. Without sensitivity labels, managing and securing sensitive data across multiple platforms would be complex and error-prone, with manual processes failing to enforce strict access controls and protect sensitive information adequately.

Implementing sensitivity labels in Microsoft 365 enhances your organization's data protection efforts, ensures compliance, and supports secure collaboration, safeguarding your firm's reputation and client trust.
