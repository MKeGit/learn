The security perimeter has shifted away from organizational boundaries to user, device, and service identities. Also, applications and data are moving to the cloud. These shifts require more secure and granular access control solutions.

This module introduces you to Conditional Access, Microsoft's Zero Trust policy engine that takes signals from various sources into account when enforcing policy decisions. You learn about Global Secure Access, Microsoft's Security Service Edge solution, which combines the identity controls you have with Conditional Access together with network controls to provide advanced protections for your internet-based resources and resources running in your private cloud or on-premises infrastructure. You also learn about Microsoft Entra roles and role-based access control, which are key to implementing least privilege access, a guiding principle of a Zero Trust strategy security.

In this module, you learn how to:

- Describe Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra.
- Describe Global Secure Access in Microsoft Entra.
- Describe Microsoft Entra roles and role-based access control.
