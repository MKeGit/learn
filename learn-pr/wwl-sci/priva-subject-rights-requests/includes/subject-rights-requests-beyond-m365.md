This feature, currently in preview, helps organizations locate, manage, and fulfill requests involving personal data across multicloud environments such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, as well as on-premises systems. By integrating with Microsoft Purview Data Map, Priva ensures data owners can efficiently identify, extract, or delete personal data as needed.
