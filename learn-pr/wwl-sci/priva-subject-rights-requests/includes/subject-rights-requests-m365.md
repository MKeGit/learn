Microsoft Priva Subject Rights Requests streamline the process of responding to privacy requests by automating data discovery and enabling collaborative workflows. Once a request is created, Priva identifies and collects relevant data across Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.

The tool is designed to improve efficiency and accuracy. It enables teams to redact sensitive information, tag items for follow-up, and determine what to include in the response. A detailed request page tracks progress, provides guidance, and offers insights into status and next steps.

### Key capabilities

- **Efficient data discovery**: After a request is submitted, Priva identifies personal data such as files, emails, and chats. The data is retrieved within a few hours, depending on volume, and search parameters can be adjusted before the collection begins.
- **Content prioritization**: The request details page highlights priority items, such as confidential data or files with personal information about multiple individuals. These insights help teams focus on items that may require special handling or redaction.
- **Streamlined collaboration**: Each request automatically creates a dedicated Microsoft Teams channel, where stakeholders can collaborate. Built-in tools for redaction, tagging, and note-taking simplify the review process.
- **Automated reporting**: Priva generates comprehensive reports, including a data package for the data subject, audit logs, and an internal summary of tagged files.
- **Integrated automation**: Priva integrates with Power Automate to support workflows like reminders or ServiceNow processes. The Microsoft 365 Subject Rights Request API also enables further automation for privacy management.

### Request progress stages

Subject rights requests follow a structured process with both automated and manual stages:

1. **Estimate data**: Priva calculates the estimated volume of relevant data. For large requests, this stage may pause for review before data retrieval begins.
2. **Retrieve data**: Priva collects content that matches the request criteria, including files, emails, and chats. This stage progresses automatically once retrieval is complete.
3. **Review data**: Collaborators review the retrieved content, redact sensitive information, add notes, and tag items for inclusion or exclusion. Users manually advance the request to the reporting stage when the review is complete.

### Managing requests with the request details page

The request details page is the central hub for managing subject rights requests. Access it by signing in to the Microsoft Priva portal (preview), navigating to **Subject Rights Requests**, and selecting a request.

- **Overview tab**: Displays key details like request status, deadline, creation date, and stage progress.
- **Data collected tab**: Shows retrieved items and provides tools for previewing, redacting, and marking items for inclusion or exclusion.
- **Notes tab**: Allows team members to document work completed on the request. Notes are visible to collaborators but not shared with the data subject.
- **Collaborators tab**: Lists team members working on the request and links to the associated Teams channel. New collaborators can be added here.
- **Reports tab**: Displays reports generated for the request, including data subject packages and internal summaries.
- **History tab**: Tracks key events and progress, such as stage changes and item counts for redaction, inclusion, and tagging.
