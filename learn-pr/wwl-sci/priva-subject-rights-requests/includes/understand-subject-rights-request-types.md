Microsoft Priva offers two types of subject rights requests to help organizations manage privacy requests efficiently:

- **Requests for data within Microsoft 365**: These requests focus on personal data stored in Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and others.
- **Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 (preview)**: These extend the subject rights requests' capabilities to multicloud and on-premises data sources, powered by the Microsoft Purview Data Map.

## Requests for data within Microsoft 365

This type of subject rights request is designed to manage privacy-related requests for data stored within the Microsoft 365 environment. When an individual submits a request, such as accessing, correcting, or deleting their personal data, the subject rights request tool automates the process by searching across platforms like Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams to locate relevant information quickly and securely.

## Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 (preview)

Subject rights requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 expand the tool's capabilities to include non-Microsoft data sources, such as Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), on-premises databases, and non-Microsoft platforms.

The **Microsoft Purview Data Map** plays a key role in supporting these requests. It provides a live inventory of an organization's data assets across multicloud and on-premises environments. By continuously discovering, classifying, and tracking data, the Data Map enables organizations to locate and retrieve personal data from diverse systems.

This integration simplifies the process of responding to complex privacy requests, ensures compliance with regulatory obligations, and offers clear visibility into where personal data resides across the organization's complete data landscape.
