Microsoft Priva offers two types of subject rights requests to help organizations efficiently manage privacy requests and meet regulatory requirements:

- **Requests for data within Microsoft 365:** These focus on personal data stored in Microsoft 365 services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and more.
- **Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 (preview):** These extend capabilities to multicloud and on-premises data sources, powered by the Microsoft Purview Data Map.

## Requests for data within Microsoft 365

This type of subject rights request helps manage privacy requests for data stored in the Microsoft 365 environment. It simplifies the process by automatically finding personal data such as emails, files, and chats in platforms like Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams. This approach ensures requests are completed efficiently and securely while reducing the work required from your team.

## Requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 (preview)

Subject rights requests for data beyond Microsoft 365 make it possible to manage privacy requests for data stored in non-Microsoft systems, such as Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and on-premises databases. These requests use the Microsoft Purview Data Map, which maintains a real-time inventory of an organization’s data across multiple environments, including multicloud and on-premises systems.

The Data Map allows organizations to find personal data efficiently by continuously discovering, organizing, and tracking information. This ensures compliance with privacy regulations and helps organizations confidently handle requests involving data stored outside Microsoft 365.

### The role of the Microsoft Purview Data Map

The Microsoft Purview Data Map is a foundational service that supports privacy and data management across an organization’s entire data landscape. It enables:

- **Data discovery:** Automatically identifies data across multicloud and on-premises systems.
- **Data classification:** Categorizes and labels data for easier tracking and management.
- **Workflow integration:** Connects seamlessly with subject rights requests to streamline the process of finding and retrieving personal data.
