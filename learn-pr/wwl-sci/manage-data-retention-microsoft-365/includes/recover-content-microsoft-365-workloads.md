### Restore items in the recycle bin that were deleted from SharePoint or Teams

Maintaining data consistency across collaboration platforms like SharePoint and Microsoft Teams is crucial for operational efficiency and regulatory compliance:

1. Navigate to SharePoint site that the items were deleted from. In Microsoft Teams, from the **Files** tab at the top of your channel, select **More** > **Open in SharePoint**.
1. In the Quick Launch bar navigation on the bottom left of the screen, select **Recycle bin**.
1. Select **Settings** > **Site contents**.
1. The recycle bin is in the top right of the Site Contents page.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/sharepoint-recycle-bin.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the SharePoint Recycle bin.":::

1. On the Recycle bin page, select the checkbox to the left of the items or files you want to restore, then select **Restore**.

When an item is restored, it's restored to the same location from which it was deleted.

### Restore a previous version of an item or file in SharePoint

SharePoint enables you to restore earlier versions of documents to safeguard your work from accidental changes or damage. This feature is essential for fixing mistakes, undoing unwanted updates, or recovering from data corruption:

1. Navigate to SharePoint site that the items are located, then open the list or library from the Quick Launch bar.

   If the name of your list or library doesn't appear, select **Site contents** or **View All Site Content**, then select the name of your list or library.

1. Right-click on the document name and select **Version History**. If **Version History** isn't visible, select the ellipses (...), then select **Version History**.

   A list of versions of the files appears.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/sharepoint-version-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing version history in SharePoint.":::

1. In the **Version History** dialog, hover over the version you want to restore, then select **Restore**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/sharepoint-restore-version.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the menu to restore a version in SharePoint.":::

1. To confirm restoring the current version as the latest version, select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/sharepoint-restore-dialogue.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the dialogue to restore a file in SharePoint over the current version.":::

The document has been successfully restored and has overwritten the last version. SharePoint doesn't remove the earlier version you just restored. It creates a copy and makes it the latest version.

### Versions from Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise

When precise version control is necessary, especially in collaborative environments, Microsoft 365 apps for enterprise provide tools to review and restore document versions meticulously. This ensures that only the most accurate and intended versions of documents are in use:

1. Navigate to SharePoint Online in your tenant.
1. Select the site collection that contains the file you want to compare.
1. Navigate to the document location in the document library.
1. Select the checkbox to the left of the item you want to compare and select **Open in app** from the top pane.
1. In Microsoft Word, select **Review** > **Compare** > **Specific Version...** on the navigation ribbon.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/sharepoint-compare-word-ribbon.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to access the Specific Version feature in Word's Review tab.":::

1. A dialogue window displays the version history, similar to what is seen in SharePoint.

From here, you can select a version to view a side-by-side comparison of the document versions.

Using these recovery and version control tools in Microsoft 365 effectively is important for maintaining data integrity and compliance in your organization.
