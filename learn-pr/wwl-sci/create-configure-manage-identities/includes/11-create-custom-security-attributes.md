## What is a custom security attribute?

Custom security attributes in Microsoft Entra ID are business-specific attributes (key-value pairs) that you can define and assign to Microsoft Entra objects. These attributes can be used to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over specific Azure resources.

### Why use custom security attributes?

 -  Extend user profiles, such as add Employee Hire Date and Hourly Salary to all my employees.
 -  Ensure only administrators can see the Hourly Salary attribute in my employees' profiles.
 -  Categorize hundreds or thousands of applications to easily create a filterable inventory for auditing.
 -  Grant users access to the Azure Storage blobs belonging to a project.

### What can I do with custom security attributes?

 -  Define business-specific information (attributes) for your tenant.
 -  Add a set of custom security attributes on users, applications, Microsoft Entra resources, or Azure resources.
 -  Manage Microsoft Entra objects using custom security attributes with queries and filters.
 -  Provide attribute governance so attributes determine who can get access.
