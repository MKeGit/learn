Now it's time to validate that our Microsoft Sentinel deployment is receiving security events and creating incidents from virtual machines that run Windows.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to perform a simulated attack to validate that the Analytic and Automation rules create an incident and assign it to the `Operator1`. You'll perform a `Privilege Escalation` attack on `vm1`.
