Multifactor authentication is a process in which users are prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification, such as a code on their cellphone or a fingerprint scan.

Multifactor authentication dramatically improves the security of an identity, while still being simple for users. The extra authentication factor must be something that's difficult for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.

Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication works by requiring:

- **Something you know** – typically a password or PIN **and**
- **Something you have** – such as a trusted device that's not easily duplicated, like a phone or hardware key **or**
- **Something you are** – biometrics like a fingerprint or face scan.

Multifactor authentication verification prompts are configured to be part of the Microsoft Entra sign-in event. Microsoft Entra ID automatically requests and processes multifactor authentication, without you making any changes to your applications or services. When a user signs in, they receive a multifactor authentication prompt, and can choose from one of the additional verification forms that they've registered.

An administrator can require certain verification methods, or the user can access their MyAccount to edit or add verification methods.

The following additional forms of verification, described in the previous unit, can be used with Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication:

- Microsoft Authenticator app
- Windows Hello for Business
- FIDO2 security key
- OATH hardware token (preview)
- OATH software token
- SMS
- Voice call

### Security defaults and multifactor authentication

Security defaults are a set of basic identity security mechanisms recommended by Microsoft. When enabled, these recommendations are automatically enforced in your organization. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security enabled at no extra cost. These defaults enable some of the most common security features and controls, including:

- Enforcing Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication registration for all users.
- Forcing administrators to use multifactor authentication.
- Requiring all users to complete multifactor authentication when needed.

Security defaults are a great option for organizations that want to increase their security posture but don’t know where to start, or for organizations using the free tier of Microsoft Entra ID licensing.  Security defaults may not be appropriate for organizations with Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 licenses or more complex security requirements.
