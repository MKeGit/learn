With the Entra plugin enabled, security analysts can instantly get a risk summary, steps to remediate, and recommended guidance for each identity at risk, in natural language. Analysts can use Copilot to guide in the creation of a lifecycle workflow to streamline the process of creating and issuing user credentials and access rights. These and many other Entra capabilities are supported by Copilot.

Microsoft Entra capabilities in Copilot are built-in prompts that you can use but you can also enter your own prompts based on the capabilities supported.

Microsoft Entra integration with Copilot can also be experienced through the embedded experience, referred to as Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Entra.  

For example, the risky users' report, available from the Microsoft Entra admin center under Identity protection, embeds the capabilities of Microsoft Copilot for Security to summarize a user's risk level, provide insights relevant to the incident at hand, and provide recommendations for rapid mitigation.
