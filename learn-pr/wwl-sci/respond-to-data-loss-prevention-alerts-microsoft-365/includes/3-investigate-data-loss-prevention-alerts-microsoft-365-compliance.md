To view DLP Alerts from DLP Policies created in Microsoft Purview use the following steps:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current Microsoft Purview compliance portal [https://compliance.microsoft.com](https://compliance.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true), is being retired in 2024. The new [Microsoft Purview portal](https://purview.microsoft.com/) is available. We recommend you become familiar with the steps to navigate to and manage *Data loss prevention alerts* in the new *Microsoft Purview* portal. In either portal you must have the correct permissions assigned to use DLP.

1. In the *new* [Microsoft Purview portal](https://purview.microsoft.com/), on the left navigation menu select the **Solutions** icon and select **Data loss prevention**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Once you select a solution in the new Microsoft Purview portal, an *icon* for that solution is displayed in the navigation menu.
