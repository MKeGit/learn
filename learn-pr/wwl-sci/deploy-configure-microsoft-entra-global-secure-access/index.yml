  title: Deploy and Configure Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access
  description: "The modern workforce transitioned from traditional office settings to working from nearly anywhere. This change in working location necessitates an identity-aware, cloud-delivered network perimeter. This identity-aware perimeter is known as Security Service Edge (SSE). The Microsoft SSE solution includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, collectively referred to as Global Secure Access. This solution is founded on Zero Trust principles, emphasizing least privilege, explicit verification, and an assumption of breach to ensure security in the cloud era."
