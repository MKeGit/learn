The modern workforce transitioned from traditional office settings to working from nearly anywhere. The transition in working location necessitates an identity-aware, cloud-delivered network perimeter. This identity-aware perimeter is known as Security Service Edge (SSE). The Microsoft SSE solution includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, collectively referred to as Global Secure Access. This solution is founded on Zero Trust principles, emphasizing least privilege, explicit verification, and an assumption of breach to ensure security in the cloud era.

Scenario: Imagine your company has a sales representative working remotely from a coffee shop. The sales rep needs to access sensitive customer data stored in the company's cloud services. To ensure secure access, the representative would use Microsoft Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. In this case Microsoft Entra Private Access. This would allow the sales rep to securely connect to the company's network, authenticate their identity, and access the required data. Access happens without exposing data to the public internet; all while adhering to the Zero Trust principles of least privilege and explicit verification.

In this module, you learn how to implement Microsoft Entra Private and Microsoft Entra Internet Access using Azure and Microsoft Entra.
