Contoso wanted to improve the efficiency of the investigation of the security incidents performed by their SecOps team. <!--Marjan, the template for the summary topic was updated recently and I have tweaked the summary content to match the template. Please review the text below and make any changes required.-->

The SecOps team was spending significant time investigating the high volume of alerts they were receiving from the various products and services used by Contoso.

By using Microsoft Sentinel Analytics, the SecOps team was able to detect and analyze potential threats more effectively. They could create analytics rules that would trigger alerts.  The SecOps team was then able to effectively react to the threats based on the triggered alerts.

Without the help of Microsoft Sentinel Analytics, earlier the SecOps team wasn't able to use its time effectively on its other operations because it was spending time in manually correlating the threats and analyzing them.

In this module, you learned how Microsoft Sentinel Analytics can help SecOps to identify and stop cyberattacks.
