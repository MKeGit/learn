Data is one of an organization's most valuable assets, but it's constantly at risk. Organizations face a range of threats, including cyberattacks, insider risks, compliance challenges, and emerging risks from AI-driven services. Understanding these threats and their consequences is crucial for developing effective security strategies.

## The consequences  of data breaches and insider threats

Cyber threats targeting sensitive data are increasing in scale and sophistication. According to ENISA's 2024 _Threat Landscape_ report, data-related threats have surged, affecting public administration (12%), digital infrastructure (10%), finance (9%), and business services (8%). The report also notes that data compromise incidents rose in 2023-2024, reinforcing the need for strong data protection measures. Organizations that fail to implement security measures risk financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. ([ENISA](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/))

Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) _Insider Threats 101_ fact sheet states that the total average cost of an insider risk increased in 2023 to $16.2 million per organization, with an average of 86 days required to identify and contain such threats. These insider incidents can stem from accidental exposure, compromised credentials, or malicious intent, all of which underscore the need for proactive data protection.

Examples of data security risks include:

- **MOVEit Data Breach:** In June 2023, a vulnerability in the MOVEit file transfer software led to cyberattacks affecting thousands of organizations and nearly 100 million individuals, including major corporations and government agencies. This breach highlighted the risks of unprotected sensitive data. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_MOVEit_data_breach))
- **Social Engineering Attacks:** ENISA's report highlights a sharp rise in Business Email Compromise (BEC), where attackers manipulate employees into disclosing sensitive data. Without proper security controls, unauthorized data exposure can lead to fraud, identity theft, and corporate espionage.
- **Data Leaks and Misconfigurations:** Unintentional data exposure remains a major issue, as noted in ENISA's findings. Security misconfigurations and lack of visibility over sensitive data can lead to breaches, making it essential to implement policies that restrict unauthorized access.

## Risks organizations face

- **External threats:** Cyberattacks, phishing, and data breaches expose sensitive information and can cause financial and reputational damage.
- **Insider risks:** Employees and contractors might unintentionally or maliciously leak data, making access controls and monitoring essential.
- **Compliance challenges:** Regulations like GDPR and HIPAA impose strict requirements for data security and privacy, with severe penalties for noncompliance.
- **AI security risks:** As organizations adopt AI-driven tools, they must ensure that sensitive data isn't used or exposed in ways that could violate security policies. AI-generated content can introduce security gaps if not properly managed.

## The need for a proactive approach

To effectively address these threats, organizations must implement a proactive data protection strategy that includes:

- **Data classification and labeling** to identify and secure sensitive information, reducing the risk of exposure.
- **Data loss prevention and retention policies** to control sharing, prevent leaks, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Insider risk management tools** to detect and respond to security incidents before they escalate.
- **Dynamic security controls** to apply protections based on risk levels, reducing exposure from compromised accounts.
- **AI security measures** to protect sensitive data used in AI-driven environments, preventing unauthorized access or misuse.

A reactive approach to security often leads to increased financial losses and operational disruptions. By taking a **comprehensive and preventive** approach to data protection, organizations can safeguard their most valuable assets, maintain regulatory compliance, and reduce the likelihood of costly security incidents.
