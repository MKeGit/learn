In this module, you've learned about the current challenges with digital identities and how a decentralized identity model can address those challenges. You also learned about a decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a new type of identifier that enables a decentralized identity model where users and organizations can control how their identities or credentials are shared.

Now that you've completed, you should be able to:

- Describe the challenges with current digital identities and credentials.
- Describe decentralized identifiers.
- Describe what makes DIDs different than other identifiers.
- Describe How Verifiable credentials work.
