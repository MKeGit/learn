The traditional network security perimeter is changing as more companies move to either a hybrid cloud environment, with some resources located on-premises and some in the cloud, or a fully cloud-based network solution. Protection of your organization's assets, resources, and data is essential.

Threats can come from any direction: for instance, a Denial of Service attack on your organization’s services, or a hacker trying to access your network by attempting to penetrate your firewall. Azure offers a wide array of configurable security tools that can be customized to give you the security and control to meet your organization's needs.

In this module, you explore many different services and features of Azure that can help protect your networks, assets, and resources, including DDoS protection, Azure Firewall, network security groups, and more. You’ll also learn about Azure Key Vault and why you would use this feature to keep secrets safe.

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Describe Azure security capabilities for protecting your network.
- Describe Azure Bastion.
- Describe Azure Key Vault.
