Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management discovers vulnerable and misconfigured devices based on known attack vectors and software vulnerabilities. 

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that has implemented Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You're responsible for working with the endpoint management team to remediate weaknesses reported by Vulnerability Management. 

A new threat is listed in the Threat Analytics dashboard.  You can quickly see that none of your devices are vulnerable to this new threat because Vulnerability Management has already provided the analysis required on your devices.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management
- Identify vulnerabilities on your devices
- Track emerging threats
