Managing sensitive data is a key challenge for organizations today, especially as regulations tighten and data flows across platforms like SharePoint, Teams, and Exchange. In this module, we saw how Microsoft 365's sensitive information types (SITs), both built-in and custom, help address these issues by automating the detection and protection of sensitive data. We also explored how tools like exact data match (EDM) and keyword dictionaries can customize protection for specific business needs. This approach reduces manual monitoring while ensuring compliance

Without these automated tools, identifying sensitive information manually would be time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to potential data breaches and compliance failures. By using SITs, organizations can more easily meet regulatory requirements and protect data, reducing risk and protecting their reputation.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Recognize the difference between built-in and custom sensitivity labels
- Configure sensitive information types with exact data match-based classification
- Implement document fingerprinting
- Create custom keyword dictionaries
