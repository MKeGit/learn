The Microsoft Defender extended detection and response (XDR) connector, with incident integration, allows you to stream all Microsoft Defender XDR incidents and alerts into Microsoft Sentinel. The connector keeps the incidents synchronized between both portals. Microsoft Defender XDR incidents include all their alerts, entities, and other relevant information. They're grouped together, and are enriched by, alerts from Microsoft Defender XDR's component services, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Connecting the Microsoft Defender XDR connector is a prerequisite for configuring the *Unified Security Operations Platform* or unified security information and event management (SIEM) and XDR experience in Microsoft Defender XDR.

The connector also lets you stream advanced hunting events from all of the above components into Microsoft Sentinel. This allows you to copy those Defender components' advanced hunting queries into Microsoft Sentinel, enrich Sentinel alerts with the Defender components' raw event data to provide more insights, and store the logs with increased retention in Log Analytics.

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel left navigation menu, expand **Configuration** and then select **Data connectors**.
