With PIM, you can view activity, activations, and audit history for privileged access group members and owners within your Microsoft Entra organization.

If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who uses [Azure delegated resource management](/azure/lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management), role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here.

Follow these steps to view the audit history for privileged access groups.
