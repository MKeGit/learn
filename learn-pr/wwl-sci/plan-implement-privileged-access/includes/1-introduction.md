Increasing your Azure solution security by ensuring that administrative roles are protected and managed is required. Explore how to use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to protect your data and resources. In this module, you learn how to create an access strategy. Then you configure, and assign PIM roles and resources, and manage emergency-access accounts.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you are able to:

 -  Define a privileged access strategy for administrative users (resources, roles, approvals, thresholds).
 -  Configure PIM for Azure Roles.
 -  Configure PIM for Azure resources.
 -  Assign roles.
 -  Manage PIM requests.
 -  Analyze PIM audit history and reports.
 -  Create and manage emergency access accounts.
 -  Configure privileged access groups

Organizations want to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources. Minimizing access reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting that access. It can also help prevent an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. However, users still need to carry out privileged operations in Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure resources. Then can track and manage the need for oversight of what those users are doing with their administrator privileges.
