Managing web trackers across websites can be challenging, especially as privacy expectations grow and regulations evolve. Without visibility into trackers, organizations risk non-compliance, eroding user trust, and creating inefficiencies in tracking management. Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning addresses these challenges by providing tools to detect, categorize, and manage tracking technologies effectively.

This module demonstrated how Tracker Scanning helps organizations simplify web tracking compliance by automating detection, categorization, and analysis of trackers. With features like automated scans, tracker categorization, and integration with consent management, Priva enables organizations to align their practices with privacy standards while fostering user trust.

- Understand the purpose and benefits of Microsoft Priva Tracker Scanning.
- Configure the environment and set up prerequisites for Tracker Scanning.
- Create and manage tracker categories and assign trackers to ensure better organization and compliance.
