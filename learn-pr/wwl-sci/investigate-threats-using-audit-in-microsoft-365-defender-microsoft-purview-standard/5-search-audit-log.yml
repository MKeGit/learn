  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer just completed running a search using the Microsoft Purview Audit (Standard) solution. When Holly reviewed the search results, she noticed that several records displayed a null value in the IP address field. Why wouldn't an IP address be displayed in these records?"
    choices:
    - content: "The records were for administrator activities for Microsoft Entra ID-related events"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. For administrator activity (or activity performed by a system account) for Microsoft Entra ID-related events, the IP address isn't logged. As a result, the value displayed in this field is null."
    - content: "The records were for activities performed by external users"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These activities would still capture the IP address of the external user."
    - content: "The records were for activities performed by a trusted application calling into the service on behalf of a user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These types of activities display the IP address for the trusted application and not the IP address of the device used by the person who performed the activity."
