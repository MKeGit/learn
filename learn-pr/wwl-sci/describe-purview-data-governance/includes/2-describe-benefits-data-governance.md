Historically, data governance has been a defense mechanism, a way to make sure your data is secure and compliant. But good data governance also makes your data more visible to your users and provides many opportunities to reunite your business with the data that fuels it. 

Microsoft Purview data governance solutions leverage AI and modern technologies to ensure data quality, security, and compliance while also accelerating value creation. Before going into the descriptions of these solutions, it's important to understand some key principles and concepts associated with data governance.

#### Data governance concepts

- **Federated governance** provides a centralized place to develop data safety, quality, and standards, but provides tools to create self-service access control, discoverability, and maintenance. Federated data governance spreads ownership across your business, reducing bottlenecks and encouraging participation in the life cycle of managing, governing, consuming, and applying data.

- **Data access** is about quickly providing the right access and enforcing the right use to balance safety and innovation.

- **Data curation** is about organizing, annotating, and publishing your data so that it's safely accessible, reuseable, and protected.

- **Data discovery** is about ensuring users can find the data they need for day-to-day business and innovation.

- **Data health** is about ensuring data quality standards are maintained across your estate, and having an active data lifecycle keeping your data fresh and secure.

- **Data understanding** is about ensure data has quality descriptors that help users understand what the data is and how it should be used.

#### Data roles and responsibilities

- **Data consumers** quickly find and use relevant, trusted datasets through streamlined access request workflow.

- **Data owners** register data assets for use, manage classifications and access, and ensure high quality standards.

- **Data stewards** ensure data quality, seamless data discovery, glossary consistency, and lineage.

- **Central data office** establish and ensure governance policies, active metadata, compliance, and insights into overall governance health.
