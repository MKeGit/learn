Accessibility isn’t a one-person job, but a team effort. To ensure your product is accessible, you need to collaborate with others, such as designers, developers, testers, program managers, and users. By collaborating with others, you leverage their expertise, perspectives, and feedback, and create a more inclusive and accessible product or service. Additionally, starting accessibility from the beginning of the product planning phase is key to ensuring your product is accessible upon release.

When collaborating with others to identify and address accessibility issues, consider these strategies:

- **Communicate and educate.** 
   It’s important to communicate the importance and benefits of accessibility to your team and stakeholders, and educate them on the accessibility guidelines, standards, and best practices. You also share the results and recommendations of your accessibility testing and provide them with resources and tools to learn and improve their own accessibility skills.

- **Involve and engage.** 
   You should involve and engage your team and stakeholders in the accessibility process and assign them roles and responsibilities. An important step is to involve and engage users with disabilities and solicit their feedback and suggestions. You also create and participate in accessibility communities and networks, and exchange ideas and experiences with other accessibility professionals and advocates to broaden your inputs and deepen your insights. 

- **Review and improve.** 
   Accessibility isn’t a one-and-done exercise. It’s important to review and improve your product or service regularly and monitor its accessibility performance and compliance. You also review and improve your accessibility process and evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. Take the initiative to seek and apply feedback and suggestions from your team, stakeholders, and users, and implement changes and improvements accordingly.

Using these strategies, you make your organization more inclusive and accessible - in your products and services, and in how you work together to design, develop, assess, and test your processes and products.
