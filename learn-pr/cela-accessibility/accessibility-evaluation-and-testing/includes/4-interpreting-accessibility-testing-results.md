After conducting accessibility testing, you need to interpret the results and make recommendations for improvements. The results of accessibility testing help you identify the accessibility issues and barriers that affect the user experience for people with disabilities, and how to address them. The results also help measure the accessibility level and compliance of your product or service, and how to enhance it.

When interpreting the results of accessibility testing, you should consider the following factors:

- **Type and severity**
  Some issues and errors may have a higher impact and priority than others, depending on how they affect the functionality, usability, and accessibility of the product or service. For example, missing alternative text on all images may have a higher impact than a low color contrast of an individual icon.

- **Number and frequency**
  Some issues and errors may occur more often and consistently than others, depending on how they relate to the design and development of the product or service. For example, a missing or invalid HTML attribute may occur more frequently than a broken link.

- **Source and cause**
  Some issues and errors may originate from different sources and causes, depending on how they relate to the content, code, and technology of the product or service. For example, incorrect use of color may be caused by a design choice, a coding error, or a browser setting.
  
- **Solution and recommendation**
  Some issues and errors may have different solutions and recommendations, depending on how they relate to the guidelines, standards, and best practices of accessibility. For example, a missing alternative text for an image may be solved by adding a descriptive and meaningful text, or by removing the image if it is decorative.
