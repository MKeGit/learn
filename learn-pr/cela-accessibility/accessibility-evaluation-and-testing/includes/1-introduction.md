Accessibility is the practice of designing and developing digital products and services that are used by people with disabilities. Accessibility is not only a legal requirement, but also a moral and ethical responsibility, because it ensures that everyone participates in and benefits from the digital world.

Accessibility evaluation and testing are essential processes to ensure that accessibility is achieved and maintained throughout a product's lifecycle.
