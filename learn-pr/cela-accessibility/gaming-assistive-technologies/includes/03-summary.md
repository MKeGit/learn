In this module, you've learned about common hardware and software technologies used for gaming. Let's recap some of the things we've covered:

- Common hardware-based gaming AT includes adaptive controllers, mouth-based inputs, switch buttons, adaptive joysticks, and more.
- Common software-based gaming AT includes screen narration tools, high-contrast settings, magnification tools, captioning, input remapping, and player-to-player communication tools.
- When players can seamlessly use their AT during their gaming experiences, or the game and platform natively provide similar technologies, fewer AT users are likely to be excluded.
