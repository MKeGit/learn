The developer in the introductory scenario didn't engage the disability community during the development process. The developer might have been unsure of where to start, or had concerns about launch timelines and bandwidth. 

In this unit, learn foundational concepts for community engagement that address these concerns. These concepts include:

- Approaches that can streamline disability feedback into existing feedback loops.
- The importance of engaging diverse users and perspectives.
- Potential ways to gather feedback regardless of where your team is in the development cycle.

## Embed accessibility feedback into existing feedback processes

If your team is new to accessibility, gathering disability perspectives might seem overwhelming. Gathering these perspectives doesn't have to be the case. Think about the standard processes that your team or organization follows when gathering general user feedback or conducting user research outside  accessibility.

For example, your team might already send surveys, conduct regular research studies, or run play tests for all products in development. If so, one way to begin gathering disability feedback without creating entirely new processes or programs is simply ensuring that players with disabilities are included in these existing participant pools.

>[!Note]
> We recommend partnering with your user research team for these engagements if possible. These teams have training and expertise in how to pose meaningful questions and analyze data. If you don't have user research resources available, you can still explore efforts to embed accessibility perspectives into feedback loops.

## Include diverse users and perspectives

Before you get started, you might have questions like:

- "How many players with disabilities should be included in a feedback session?"
- "How do I know that the feedback from one player represents the feedback of other players with similar disabilities?" 

Although there's no definitive answer or guideline, it's important to note that the experience of one player with a disability can widely differ from another.

Consider including a diverse set of users and perspectives. For example, if you're looking for feedback on the visual accessibility of your game's UI, you should consider feedback from multiple players who have different types of visual disabilities.

## Gather feedback across development timelines

It's also important to remember that accessibility feedback can, and should, be gathered throughout all points of the development process. This collaboration ideally starts with planning and goal-setting stages. When you consider accessibility from the beginning, you avoid situations where accessibility features are added as last-minute efforts.

Last-minute efforts to implement accessibility solutions aren't effectively integrated within a game's design. They're unlikely to provide players with the same support and effectiveness that you achieve when you prioritize accessibility consistently from start to finish.

The following information outlines potential ways to gather feedback at various points in development:

- **Pre-development:** Even if your team hasn't begun formal planning or development, there are still opportunities to engage the disability community. Consider using this time to gather foundational insights from players about barriers they've experienced in the past while playing other games of similar genres to what your team develops. An awareness of these barriers before development can help you avoid introducing them in your game altogether.

- **Early planning and goal setting:** After you establish early planning and goals, use this information to source feedback. Players can improve accessible development by identifying potential barriers that the anticipated settings, mechanics, and other design elements might pose. They can also provide valuable feedback on your proposed accessibility goals and your plans to achieve them.

- **Prototype testing:** After working prototypes or game builds are available, consider providing hands-on opportunities for players to provide feedback through play tests or user research studies. These hands-on interactions are crucial to informing suggestions for improvement within the context of your specific game.

    As the experience or device goes through reiteration, continue to involve players with disabilities in testing. This involvement can ensure that future design iterations continue to provide effective and usable solutions for these players.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > It can be tempting to wait until playable prototypes are available to begin engaging the community. However, it's important to think about all of the potential barriers that these players identified in earlier development stages. Without this feedback, your team might include inaccessible experiences in the prototype that they were unaware of.

    > At this point in development, it might be too late to tackle a long list of identified issues that cause inaccessible experiences at launch. Collaboration throughout development can reduce the chances that major barriers to access will appear in a prototype.
