Take a moment and, using only your keyboard, go back to the previous page and then navigate back to this page. 

Keyboard accessibility is essential for individuals who cannot use a mouse due to physical disabilities or conditions that limit fine motor control. It's also critical for people who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers, which depend on keyboard navigation to function effectively. By ensuring that interfaces are fully accessible via keyboard, we create more inclusive experiences that accommodate a wider range of users, enhancing usability and equity for everyone.
