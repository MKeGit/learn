In this module, you explored the fundamental importance of keyboard support in accessibility, highlighting how it ensures that all interactive elements on a webpage or application can be operated using a keyboard alone. This is particularly crucial for users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers or those with physical impairments who cannot use a mouse. By implementing robust keyboard support, developers can create more inclusive digital experiences, catering to a diverse range of users. The module emphasized the need to ensure that all interactive elements, such as buttons, links, and form fields, are reachable and operable via the keyboard as outlined by WCAG. It also stressed the importance of maintaining a logical and intuitive focus order to help users navigate through content seamlessly, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.
