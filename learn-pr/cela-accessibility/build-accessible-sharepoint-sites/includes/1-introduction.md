In this module, you learn how to create and maintain SharePoint sites that provide a positive user experience for people with disabilities.

As a web-based platform, SharePoint enables the creation, management, and sharing of information within an organization via web sites that take the form of an intranet, extranet, or public-facing web site. SharePoint sites are used to collaborate, communicate, and manage documents. While it doesnâ€™t automatically make your sites accessible, SharePoint does offer many tools and features to help you make sites accessible, like SharePoint templates, web parts, themes, styles, and layouts.

It's recommended to follow web accessibility principles and guidelines when designing and developing your SharePoint sites. Consider the needs and preferences of your target audience. Implement best practices and recommendations for improving accessibility and usability. And test sites for accessibility issues.
