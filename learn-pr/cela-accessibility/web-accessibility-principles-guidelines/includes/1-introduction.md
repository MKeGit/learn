Web accessibility is the practice of making websites and web applications usable and accessible for people with disabilities. Beyond being a moral and ethical business responsibility, it's required by law. People with disabilities have the right to access information and communication technologies equally as those without disabilities. By ensuring web content is easy to navigate, clear, and consistent for all users, we can enhance user experiences for everyone and meet legal obligations. Technical standards explain how we can make web content accessible. In this training, we explore how standards impact web design and development.
