When creating your content, you'll want to provide an overview and context for the content you share. Headings and titles make text stand out, so people can understand how your document is organized, and screen readers can understand navigational structure. 

People using screen readers and other assistive technologies may navigate your content by using keyboard shortcuts to move from heading to heading. A title is usually the first thing a screen reader will read as the highest-level heading, followed by subheadings for other sections or topics. 

Here's how to apply headings in Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

## Exercise – Apply headings in Word

  To apply headings in Word, use the built-in Styles available in the Home tab of the ribbon. Depending on the hierarchy of your content, choose Heading 1, Heading 2, or Heading 3. Properly nesting the order of headings in your document is critical to informing screen reader users how to navigate. You can also modify the appearance of any heading by changing the font, size, color, or alignment.
