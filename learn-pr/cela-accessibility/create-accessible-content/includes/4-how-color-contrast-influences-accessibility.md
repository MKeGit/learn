## Exercise – How to check color contrast
  1. Use a color contrast analyzer or the built-in **Accessibility Checker** to verify contrast.
  1. Accessibility Checker can automatically detect and report any color and contrast issues.
  1. Adjust based on results and suggestions on how to fix issues. For example, change the color or font size, or weight, or add alternative text to images.

By following Accessibility Checker suggestions, you’ll ensure your documents are accessible and readable by everyone. More information on the Accessibility Checker is presented in the next unit.
