There are many adaptive input devices on the market that players can customize to meet their exact needs and preferences. But these players must still interact with standard gaming devices like consoles, PCs, and headsets prior to using their adaptive input devices for in-game play.

For this reason, consider including basic accessibility features and supports during hardware development of all gaming products.

## What is the role of accessibility in standard hardware development?

Unlike gaming software, hardware devices aren't as flexible or customizable to a wide range of player needs. When design is done for the masses, prioritization is generally around form factors that are small, compact, and sleek.

In contrast, many assistive technologies, or products intentionally built for players with disabilities, offer:

- Larger or "oversized" components.
- Joysticks and buttons that can be activated with low force.
- Robust options to customize other device aspects to distinct user needs.

The following image shows the difference in size and form between the Xbox Adaptive Controller, a standard Xbox Controller, and two accessibility switch buttons. The Adaptive Controller features two large-face buttons that are exponentially larger than the A B X Y buttons on a standard controller.

> [!NOTE]
> Note the similar color scheme and overall appearance of the Xbox Adaptive Controller and the standard Xbox Controller. Many bespoke assistive technology devices tend to be loud and colorful in appearance, which results in feelings of stigmatizing among users.

> One major success of the Xbox Adaptive Controller is its intentional design that makes it look like a true Xbox product. Creating accessible gaming products that are usable and also desirable is another major opportunity to be tackled in this space.

The contrast between these two design approaches can make the task of creating accessible standard hardware devices seem overwhelming. It might not be possible to meet the needs of all players with a single, standard controller, console, or headset. However, the best practices discussed in this module can usually be applied to all hardware devices.

This application can provide more accessible experiences for players with disabilities as they perform basic setup tasks like:

- Powering on their standard devices.
- Connecting their assistive technologies.
- Encountering other unavoidable interactions needed to begin play.
