In this module, you've learned about best practices for developing more accessible gaming hardware experiences and packaging components. Here's a summary of what we covered:

- Provide standard connection options like USB or Bluetooth on devices to help ensure that players can connect their assistive devices to supporting hardware products.
- Consider adjustments to button size, height, and activation force to increase the accessibility of standard hardware devices.
- Represent important device status information through multiple sensory channels like vision, audio, and tactile to ensure more players have successful interactions.
- Implement accessible packaging components like tactile cues that inform proper device orientation, pull tabs to remove adhesive, and multiple options for device and component removal.
