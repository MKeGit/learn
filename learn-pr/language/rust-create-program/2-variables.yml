      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement is missing the `let` keyword to declare the variable."
    - content: "`let continents;`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement is missing a value to bind to the variable."

  - content: "What Rust keyword is used to make the value of a variable changeable?"
    choices:
    - content: "`mutable`"

    - content: "`immutable`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. To be `immutable` means to not be changeable. What is the opposite?"

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The `mut` keyword is used to declare the value of a variable to be changeable."
