  questions:
  
  - content: "How can you declare a vector when you don't know the data type?"
    choices:
    - content: "`<vector><:?>`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The syntax `:?` is used in the `println!` macro, but not in a vector declaration."
    - content: "`<vector><T>`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The syntax `<T>` tells the compiler to use a generic type `T` declaration for the vector."
    - content: "`<vector>`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. After you provide the vector name, specify a known or generic data type."  

  - content: "What does the `pop` function do for a vector?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pops off the last value in the vector."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `pop` function removes the value at the end of a vector."
    - content: "Pops off the initial value in a vector."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `pop` function removes the value at the end of a vector."
    - content: "Adds software carbonization to a vector like *popping* bubbles in soda."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `pop` function removes the value at the end of a vector."

  - content: "What happens if you try to access a vector element with an index greater than the vector size?"
    choices:
    - content: "A null value is returned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No value of any kind can be returned because a value doesn't exist at the index location."
    - content: "A compilation error occurs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The program compiles successfully, but it returns an error when the vector is accessed with an out-of-bounds index."
    - content: "The program panics during runtime."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The program panics with an *index out of bounds* error."
