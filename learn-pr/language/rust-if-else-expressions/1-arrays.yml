  questions:

  - content: "Which syntax can be used to declare and initialize an array?"
    choices:
    - content: "`let multiples [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The element values in square brackets must be bound to the array by using the equals sign (=)."
    - content: "`let multiples = [5: 5];`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The initial array element value `5` must be followed by a semicolon."
    - content: "`let multiples = [5; 5];`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The array is defined with a length of 5, and the first element is initialized to 5."

  - content: "What happens if you try to access an array element with an index greater than the array size?"
    choices:
    - content: "The program panics during runtime."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The compiler returns an error. No executable program is produced."
    - content: "The compiler returns an error."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The compiler returns an *index out of bounds* error."
    - content: "A null value is returned."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The compiler returns an error. There's no executable program to run, or to produce output."
