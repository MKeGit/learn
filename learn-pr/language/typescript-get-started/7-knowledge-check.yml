  Choose the best response for each of the following questions:
quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the relationship between TypeScript and JavaScript?"
    choices:
    - content: "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. TypeScript is a strict superset of ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6 or ES6). This relationship means that all JavaScript code is also TypeScript code, and a TypeScript program can seamlessly consume JavaScript."
    - content: "TypeScript is exactly the same as JavaScript."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are important differences between TypeScript and JavaScript."
    - content: "TypeScript is a subset of JavaScript."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. TypeScript isn't a subset of JavaScript because it has added features that JavaScript doesn't have."
  - content: "Why is it necessary to compile (or transpile) TypeScript code to JavaScript before you can use it in your applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's not necessary because you only need to rename the TypeScript file with a .js extension for it to work."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although you can create a TypeScript file by renaming a JavaScript file with a .ts file extension, it doesn't work when you rename a TypeScript file with a .js file extension."
    - content: "TypeScript code is considered valid JavaScript while JavaScript code isn't valid TypeScript."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would make it unnecessary to compile TypeScript code to JavaScript."
    - content: "TypeScript includes code features that aren't compatible with browsers."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You must compile TypeScript code to JavaScript to remove the features that JavaScript doesn't support."
  - content: "What does the command `npm install -g typescript` do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Installs npm so you can install TypeScript."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. npm must already be installed on the machine for this command to run."
    - content: "Installs the TypeScript compiler globally on the machine."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The npm command installs the TypeScript package on the machine. The -g parameter installs it globally."
    - content: "Installs Node.js and npm."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js and npm must already be installed on the machine for this command to run."
