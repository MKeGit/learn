While generics are supported by many programming languages, including TypeScript, they're not currently available in JavaScript. So, for some JavaScript coders, generics are a mystery. Now that you're well on your way to being a TypeScript coder, let's unlock the mysteries of generics and add these useful tools to your programming toolkit.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify use cases for generics.
- Define a generic function.
- Declare a generic interface.
- Declare a generic class.
- Implement generic constraints.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of TypeScript
- Familiarity with JavaScript
- Familiarity with TypeScript functions, interfaces, and classes.
- Installed software:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/?azure-portal=true)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?azure-portal=true)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/?azure-portal=true)
