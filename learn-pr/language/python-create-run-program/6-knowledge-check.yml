        - content: It contains `program.py`, the name of the program.

          explanation: Incorrect. Position 0 is always the name of the program.
        - content: It contains `2`, the second command-line argument.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Position 0 is always the name of the program.
    - content: What will happen if you run the statement `"1" + 2`?
      choices:
        - content: It will evaluate to 3.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You need to convert the string to an integer for this statement to work. 
        - content: It will give an error.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. It will show the error message "can only concatenate str (not "int") to str".
        - content: It will become "12".
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You need to convert the string to an integer for this statement to work. For the answer to become "12", both values would need to be strings, as in "1" + "2".
