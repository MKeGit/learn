abstract:  |
  In this module, you'll practice and learn about:

  - How testing works in Go.
  - How to wrap the core logic of a program into a package.
  - How to expose the core logic through a Web API.
  - How to write tests for your core logic package (by using test-driven development).
  - How almost all concepts we've covered so far can work together.
prerequisites: | 
  - A Go environment ready to create programs. Ideally, you should have installed and configured Go locally and installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
