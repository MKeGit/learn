Computer programs are great at dealing with repetitive tasks. As a developer, you'll often find yourself needing to loop over sequences of values, such as strings, numbers, and objects. Python provides two mechanisms for performing such tasks, which are `while` and `for` loops.

## Scenario: Working with flow control on a planetary app

Imagine you're creating an application where users enter a list of planet names. After the users enter the names, you display the results back to them. This scenario requires prompting the users multiple times to enter values. When they're done, the code displays all the data in the list. In this module, we explore how you can use `while` and `for` loops to create this application.

By the end of the module, you'll be able to use `while` and `for` loops.

## What are you learning?

After you've completed this module, you can:

- Identify when to use `while` and `for` loops.
- Run a task multiple times by using `while` loops.  
- Loop over list data by using `for` loops.

## What is the main objective?

In this module, learn how to apply flow control to your app to repeat statements and work with list structures.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with the concept of programming.

You don't need to install Python to complete this module. You'll use an interactive sandbox to complete the exercises.
