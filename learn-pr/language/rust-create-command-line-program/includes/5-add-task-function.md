The `add_task` function needs to append a new `Task` value to a possibly existing collection of tasks that's encoded in a JSON file.

So, before inserting a task into that collection, we must first read that file and assemble a vector of tasks from its contents.

The first version looks like this:

```rust

use std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};
use std::path::PathBuf;
use std::io::{Result, Seek, SeekFrom};
  // ...

pub fn add_task(journal_path: PathBuf, task: Task) -> Result<()> {
    // Open the file.
    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .read(true)
        .write(true)
        .create(true)
        .open(journal_path)?;

    // Consume the file's contents as a vector of tasks.
    let mut tasks: Vec<Task> = match serde_json::from_reader(&file) {
        Ok(tasks) => tasks,
        Err(e) if e.is_eof() => Vec::new(),
        Err(e) => Err(e)?,
    };

    // Rewind the file after reading from it.
    file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0))?;

    // Write the modified task list back into the file.
    tasks.push(task);
    serde_json::to_writer(file, &tasks)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Let's go over this function in four steps:

## Open the file

First, we open the file by using `OpenOptions`, which allows us to specify some modes for operating on the file, like `read`, `write`, and `create` (for when the file doesn't yet exist).

The question mark symbol (`?`) after that statement is used to propagate errors without writing too much boilerplate code. It's syntax sugar for early returning an error if that error matches with the return type of the function it's in. So these snippets are equivalent:

```rust
fn function_1() -> Result(Success, Failure) {
    match operation_that_might_fail() {
        Ok(success) => success,
        Err(failure) => return Err(failure),
    }
}

fn function_2() -> Result(Success, Failure) {
    operation_that_might_fail()?
}
```

That pattern is used a lot in code that needs to do multiple I/O operations, as we do in this program.

## Build a reader and consume its contents as a vector of tasks

The second step is to actually read the file. To read the file, `serde_json` asks for any type that implements the `Reader` trait. The `File` type implements that trait, so we just pass it as a parameter to the `serde_json.from_reader` function while declaring that we expect to receive a `Vec<Task>` from it.

Keep in mind that accessing the file system is an I/O action that can fail for various reasons. So we need to consider how our program should behave (and possibly recover) in some specific cases. For example, `serde_json` returns an error when it reaches the end of a file without having found anything to parse. This event always happens in an empty file, and we need to be able to recover from it.

To recover from specific kinds of errors, we use *guards* in the `match` expression to filter out the specific matches of **Ok** and **Err** and build an empty `Vec` when the specific error occurs. The `Vec` represents an empty to-do list.

The `serde_json::Error` can easily be converted to the `std::io::Error` type because [it
implements the `From` trait](https://docs.serde.rs/serde_json/error/struct.Error.html#impl-From%3CError%3E?azure-portal=true). That makes it possible for us to use the `?` operator to unpack or early return them.

## Rewind the file after reading from it

Because we moved the cursor to the end of the file, we need to rewind the file before we write over it again. If we don't rewind the file, we'd begin writing at the cursor's last position, which would cause a malformed JSON file. We use the `Seek` trait and the `SeekFrom` enum from the `std::io` module to rewind the file.

## Write the modified task list back into the file

Finally, we push the `Task` value received as a function parameter to the task list and use `serde_json` to write the task vector into the file. We then return the empty tuple value inside an `Ok` to indicate that everything went according to our plans.
