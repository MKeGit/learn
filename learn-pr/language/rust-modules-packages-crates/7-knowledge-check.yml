  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements does *not* describe modules in Rust?"
    choices:
    - content: "A module is a (possibly nested) unit of code organization inside a crate."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement describes a characteristic of Rust modules."
    - content: "There are two ways to declare modules in Rust: inline or in another file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement describes a characteristic of Rust modules."
    - content: "A module is a compilation unit, which is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler can operate on."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The smallest compilation unit in Rust is a *crate*, and not a *module*."
  - content: "Which of the following statements does *not* describe third-party modules in Rust?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dependencies can be fetched and compiled by Cargo."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement describes a characteristic of third-party modules in Rust."
    - content: "Third-party crates and their intended versions should be declared in the `src/main.rs` file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Third-party crates in Rust should be declared in the `Cargo.toml` file."
    - content: "Dependencies are normally fetched from the Crates.io repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement describes a characteristic of third-party modules in Rust."
    - content: "Only public items can be accessed from third-party crates."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement describes a characteristic of third-party modules in Rust."
  - content: "Which of the following statements best describes a crate?"
    choices:
    - content: "A crate is a compilation unit, which is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler can operate on."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This statement best describes a crate."
    - content: "A crate contains a *Cargo.toml* file that describes how to build it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement best describes a *package*."
    - content: "A crate is a collection of items that includes constants, type aliases, functions, structs, and more."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This statement best describes a *module*."
    - content: "Crates control the privacy of items and whether they can be used by external code."
      isCorrect: false
