To be an effective developer, you need to know how exceptions work and how to handle them. In this module, you learned about using exception output for debugging, how to catch and raise exceptions, and finally how to affect a program's logic when exceptions happen.

With the knowledge of using and handling exceptions, you can avoid common pitfalls like catching all of them to prevent tracebacks.

In this module, you learned these skills:

- Read and use error output from exceptions.
- Properly handle exceptions.
- Raise exceptions with useful error messages.
- Use exceptions to control a program's flow.
