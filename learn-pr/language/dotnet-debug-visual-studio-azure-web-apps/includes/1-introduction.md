Visual Studio provides powerful tools to help you debug and diagnose issues in your applications during development. You can also use these tools to troubleshoot problems with apps that are running on other computers and servers, or even hosted in Azure.

## Troubleshooting issues in production

Suppose you work for a team that recently built and deployed an application to Azure App Service. However, although the app runs correctly locally, you've started to notice issues while it's running in production in Azure. You're looking for more tools and assistance to quickly track down the problems that are impacting real users. It's sometimes faster to troubleshoot these issues directly in production environments rather than spending time trying to recreate the issue locally or in development systems.

## What will we learn?

This module demonstrates how to use Visual Studio remote debugging features with Azure App Service and perform related configurations. You'll see how to attach to and directly debug processes that are running externally in the cloud. You'll also explore how to configure your debugging settings to make this functionality work seamlessly.

> [!NOTE]
> Remote debugging is only available for Windows Azure App Services (not supported on Linux instances).

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to use Visual Studio's debugging tools to diagnose problems in your applications hosted on Azure App Service.
