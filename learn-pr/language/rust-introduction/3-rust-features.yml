  questions:

  - content: "What's a compelling advantage of working with Rust?"
    choices:
    - content: "Rust is type-safe, memory-safe, and data race-free."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Data types in Rust are verified at compile time, pointers (references) always refer to valid memory, and thread-safety is guaranteed."
    - content: "Rust is optimized for bare-metal development like operating systems."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rust can be used to implement embedded functionality, but the language is well suited for all development. Programmers also use Rust to build tools, write web apps, and do high-level abstractions."
    - content: "Rust has a robust garbage collector and helps to manage memory efficiently."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Rust doesn't have a built-in garbage collector. Rust produces a minimal runtime, which is also optional."

  - content: "How is Rust code executed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Scripts are interpreted by Rust."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Rust programs aren't compiled into a script, but as an executable file."
    - content: "Rust code must be included in a C/C++ source file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Rust code must be included in a Rust source file with the proper extension, and be compiled before it's run."
    - content: "Through compilation followed by direct execution."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Rust code is compiled into an executable file, and then the executable is run."

  - content: "What's an example of something you *can't* do with Cargo?"
    choices:
    - content: "Build an existing Rust project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can build a project with Cargo by using the command `cargo build`."
    - content: "Update the installed Rust compiler version."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can't update the Rust compiler version by using Cargo. Use the `rustup` command to update the Rust compiler version."
    - content: "Publish a library to *Crates.io*."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You can publish a library with Cargo by using the command `cargo publish`."
