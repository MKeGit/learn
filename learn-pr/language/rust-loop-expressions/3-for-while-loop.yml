  questions:
  
  - content: "What kind of iteration works best to ensure all data in a collection is processed?"
    choices:
    - content: "`while <x> is true`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A `while` expression repeats actions as long as a condition remains true. If the condition evaluates to false, the `while` loop might stop before all data is processed."
    - content: "`for <i> in <x>`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A `for` expression repeats actions for all values in a collection. The `for` loop works best when you want to ensure all data in a collection is processed."
    - content: "`loop until stopped`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A `loop` expression repeats actions until a manual stop occurs. A `loop` can continue after all data in a collection is processed. The same data might be processed more than once."

  - content: "What keyword causes a `loop` expression to end?"
    choices:
    - content: "`stop`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `Stop!` can be seen at street intersections, but it's not used to end a `loop` process."
    - content: "`halt`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. `Halt!` occurs in medieval literature, but it's not used to end a `loop` process."
    - content: "`break`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! To end a `loop` process, we use the `break` keyword."
