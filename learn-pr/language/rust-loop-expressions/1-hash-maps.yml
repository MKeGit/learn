  questions:
  
  - content: "What data type is best for representing an address book that associates people's names to their phone numbers?"
    choices:
    - content: "A tuple"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With a tuple, you can only group values into one compound. We can have a combined tuple of names and phone numbers, but we can't easily map them together."
    - content: "A vector"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With a vector, you can only store a collection of objects. You wouldn't know how to relate a person's name to their phone number."
    - content: "An array"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An array is a collection of similar objects. You wouldn't know how to relate a person's name to their phone number."
    - content: "A hash map"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With a hash map, you can store a mapping of keys to values. So each name key could have a corresponding phone number as a value."
  
  - content: "What standard methods can you use to add and delete hash map elements?"
    choices:
    - content: "`.add()` and `.remove()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A standard method named `add` isn't used with hash maps."
    - content: "`.insert()` and `.remove()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You add elements with the `.insert()` method and delete elements with the `.remove()` method."
    - content: "`.insert()` and `.delete()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A standard method named `delete` isn't used with hash maps."
