Azure Storage provides a layered security model. You can use this model to secure your storage accounts to a specific set of supported networks. When you set up network rules, only applications that request data over the specified networks can access your storage account. 

Authorization is supported by a public preview of Microsoft Entra credentials (for blobs and queues), a valid account access key, or a shared access signature (SAS) token. Data encryption is enabled by default, and you can proactively monitor systems by using Advanced Threat Protection.
