In this module, you learned how clustering can be used to create unsupervised machine learning models that group data observations into clusters. You then used the **scikit-learn** framework in Python to train a clustering model.

While scikit-learn is a popular framework for writing code to train clustering models, you can also create machine learning solutions for clustering using the graphical tools in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. You can learn more about no-code development of clustering models using Azure Machine Learning in the [Create a clustering model with Azure Machine Learning designer](/training/modules/create-clustering-model-azure-machine-learning-designer/) module.

## Challenge: Cluster Unlabeled Data

Now that you've seen how to create a clustering model, why not try for yourself? You'll find a clustering challenge in the [Clustering Challenge](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/blob/master/challenges/04%20-%20Clustering%20Challenge.ipynb) notebook!

> [!NOTE]
> The time to complete this optional challenge is not included in the estimated time for this module - you can spend as little or as much time on it as you like!
