  questions:
  - content: "What's one thing that files with the *.mbconfig* extension allow you to do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Save your Visual Studio settings."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Files with the *.mbconfig* extension save settings and state related to Model Builder, not to Visual Studio."
    - content: "Save your Model Builder state."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! If you close Model Builder at any point, you can open the *.mbconfig* file and pick up where you left off."
    - content: "Provide a name for the .NET project where you're adding a machine learning model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although the *.mbconfig* file allows you to provide a name for your model, it doesn't allow you to set the name of the .NET project where you're adding a machine learning model."
  - content: "What is the value that you're trying to predict commonly called?"
    choices:
    - content: "Label"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The value that you're trying to predict is often called a label."
    - content: "Feature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Features are the inputs that determine the value you're trying to predict."
    - content: "Supervised learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Supervised learning is the broader machine learning task where the value that you're trying to predict is known ahead of time."
  - content: "What's one reason you would choose Azure over a local training environment?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can't train locally with Model Builder."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "By using Model Builder, you can train locally on your computer and in Azure, depending on the scenario."
    - content: "You want to use a GPU for consumption."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Model consumption happens after training."
    - content: "You don't have a GPU or a computer with enough CPU or RAM for resource-intensive scenarios like image classification."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! By using Azure compute resources, you can lighten the load on your local computer."
