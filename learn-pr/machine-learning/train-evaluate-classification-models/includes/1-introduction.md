*Classification* is a form of machine learning where you train a model to predict which category an item belongs to. For example, a health clinic might use patient diagnostic data such as height, weight, blood pressure, and blood glucose level to predict whether the patient is diabetic.

*Categorical* data has *classes* rather than numeric values. Some kinds of data can be either numeric or categorical. For example, the time to run a race could be a numeric time in seconds, or a categorical class of fast, medium, or slow. Other kinds of data can only be categorical, such as a type of shape - circle, triangle, or square.

## Prerequisites

* Knowledge of basic mathematics
* Some experience programming in Python

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:
