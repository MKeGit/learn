## Summary ##
With our online grocery website launching soon, we had to build an identity solution that allows our customers to create an account on the website. Our marketing team needed to make sure our brand was showing through our experiences, and the security team wanted to make sure that our customers’ accounts are protected by security.

Entra External Identities let us configure settings mapped to requirements in the Entra Admin portal and through calling Graph API. We needed to create a tenant to store user accounts, register our app, and then create and customize the user flow for sign-in and sign-up experiences. These experiences reflected our configuration of branding, the information we collected from users, the types of accounts they could use, information verification, and account security by prompting users to enroll in a multifactor authentication method.

Without using a product like Entra External Identities, the task would be significantly more complex. We would need to build our own identity management system from scratch, which would involve writing extensive code for account creation, sign-in, and sign-up processes. We would also need to implement our own security measures, including multifactor authentication, and ensure they meet industry standards. Additionally, we would have to create a system for customizing the user experience to reflect our branding, and all of this would need to be hosted on our own servers, requiring additional infrastructure and maintenance.

Using Entra External Identities has had a profound impact on our grocery business. It has streamlined the process of creating and managing user accounts, saving us significant time and resources that would have been spent on developing and maintaining our own system. The product’s robust security features and customizable user experience have enhanced our brand’s reputation and trust among our customers. Furthermore, the cloud-hosted identity solution has eliminated the need for us to manage our own servers, increasing operational efficiency and allowing us to deliver a more reliable, resilient, and seamless experience to our customers without compromising security.
