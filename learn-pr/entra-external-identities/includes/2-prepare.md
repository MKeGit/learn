## Project overview

Our project aims to launch a new website for our online grocery retailer. The primary goal is to ensure seamless sign-in and account creation experiences for both existing and new customers. The marketing team emphasizes brand representation, while the security team focuses on protecting user accounts. To achieve this, weâ€™ll implement Entra External Identities, a cloud-hosted identity and access management solution.

### High-level approach

1. **Tenant creation:** Set up a tenant to store user accounts securely.
1. **App registration:** Register our app to integrate with Entra External Identities.
1. **Customized user experiences:**
    - **During sign-in:** Customize the sign-in process, including branding elements.
    - **During sign-up:** Configure account creation, attribute collection, account types, and extension for information verification.
1. **Account security:** Prompt users to enroll in multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
