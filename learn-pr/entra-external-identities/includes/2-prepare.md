## Project overview

Our project aims to launch a new website for our online grocery retailer. The primary goal is to ensure seamless sign-in and account creation experiences for both existing and new customers. The marketing team emphasizes brand representation, while the security team focuses on protecting user accounts. To achieve this, we’ll implement Entra External Identities, a cloud-hosted identity and access management solution.

### High-level approach

1. **Tenant Creation:** We’ll set up a tenant to store user accounts securely.
1. **App Registration:** Register our app to integrate with Entra External Identities.
1. **Customized User Experiences:**
    - **During Sign-In:** Customize the sign-in process, including branding elements.
    - **During Sign-Up:** Configure account creation, attribute collection, account types, and extension for information verification.
1. **Account Security:** Prompt users to enroll in multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
