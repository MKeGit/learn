In this module, you learned how to prepare a project for Progressive Web App (PWA) integration by assessing its core features, implementing best practices, and updating dependencies. 

You used [PWABuilder](https://aka.ms/pwa/mslearn/data) to evaluate a website's PWA readiness, generate an app manifest and service worker files, and customize its settings and appearance. You also explored how to modify your PWA's icons, theme colors, and display options, as well as configure features like push notifications, background sync, and offline analytics. Following these steps transforms your web project into a fully functional PWA that provides an enhanced, app-like experience to users.

The next steps are to test the PWA and publish it to the Microsoft Store.
