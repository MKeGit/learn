In this module, we'll explore the world of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and how [PWABuilder](https://aka.ms/pwa/mslearn/data), an open-source tool developed by Microsoft, streamlines the PWA development process. To illustrate the benefits of using PWAs, let's consider a scenario where a growing e-commerce company specializing in eco-friendly products, called `Contoso EcoEmporium`, wants to enhance its Windows users' online shopping experience. Being mainly a website company, they lack any closeness to the users; one proposed solution is to create applications for all types of devices, but the solution is costly and will result in less budget for environmental initiatives.
