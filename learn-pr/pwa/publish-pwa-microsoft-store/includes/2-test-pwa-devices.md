## Test on browsers, devices, and operating systems

Use various browsers (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) to test your PWA. This ensures no unexpected bugs are formed during code addition. Identify any compatibility or performance issues and resolve them.

When testing a PWA that primarily targets the Windows platform, pay special attention to the following:

- **Microsoft Edge**: Ensure that your PWA works seamlessly on the Microsoft Edge browser, as it's the default browser for Windows devices.
- **Windows features**: Test your app's integration with Windows-specific features such as taskbar icons and window controls overlay.
- **Installation experience**: Verify that the installation process works smoothly on Windows devices, providing users with a seamless app-like experience.
- **Responsiveness**: Check if your app's layout and design adapt well to different screen sizes and resolutions, especially when used on various Windows devices.
- **Performance**: Test your app's performance on a range of devices with different hardware specifications to ensure that it provides a consistent user experience.
- **Offline capabilities**: Test your app's offline functionality and caching mechanisms to make sure it works reliably under different network conditions.
