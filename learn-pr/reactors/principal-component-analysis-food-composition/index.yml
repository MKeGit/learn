title: Principal component analysis with food composition
summary: Learn how to use principal component analysis (PCA) to learn about the contents of a food nutrition dataset.
abstract:  | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Learn the terms *principal component analysis (PCA)* and *eigenvector*, and understand their functions in machine learning.
  - Learn about PCA theory, and then apply PCA to a food composition dataset.
  - Check for correlation in a dataset, and then normalize and center the data.
  
  This is complementary content for Microsoft Reactor Workshops.
prerequisites: |
  - Text classification with Naive Bayes
