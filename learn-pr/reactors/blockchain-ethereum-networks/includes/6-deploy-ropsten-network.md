Now we have a smart contract. We've successfully deployed it to our development network. Next we'll focus on deploying to the Ropsten test network.

## Exercise overview

For this tutorial, we'll deploy to Ropsten by using MetaMask with test ether. The deployment process requires setting up an [Infura](http://www.infura.io/?azure-portal=true) account to connect and deploy to the Ropsten testnet. After we deploy, we can use Ropsten Testnet Explorer to inspect the blocks that have been deployed to the testnet.

## Exercise setup

To set up the exercise, you'll:
1. Install and set up MetaMask.
1. Get test ether.
1. Install HDWallet-Provider and fs.
1. Install Infura and link the endpoints to the Ropsten test network.
### Set up MetaMask

If you haven't done so already, [install and set up MetaMask](https://metamask.io?azure-portal=true). Then sign in to your account in the browser.

### Add ether to the MetaMask Ropsten test network

Use your MetaMask account to connect to the Ropsten test network. Begin by getting test ether from the Ropsten Test Faucet:

1. Open MetaMask.
1. Connect to Ropsten.
1. Copy the address of your account.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/metamask-0-ether-connect.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the MetaMask browser extension where you can copy the account address.":::

1. Open a browser window or tab, and go to the Ropsten faucet.
1. To request ether, enter your testnet account address and then select **Send me test Ether**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/ropsten-test-faucet-request-ether.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to request test ether on the Ropsten faucet.":::

1. In MetaMask, verify that you now have ether in your account.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/metamask-ropsten-test-with-1-ether.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the MetaMask browser extension. The account lists the ether quantity.":::

### Install HDWallet-Provider and fs

Next you'll need [HDWallet-Provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@truffle/hdwallet-provider?azure-portal=true). This wallet-enabled Web3 provider creates your secret mnemonic and connection network address. You'll also need [fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs?azure-portal=true) to read from your file system.

To install both tools, return to the *todolist* project in Visual Studio Code. Open the terminal pane and run the following commands:

1. `npm init`
1. `npm install fs`
1. `npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider`

Wait for the installations of fs and HDWallet-Provider to finish. You might see several warnings. As long as these warnings aren't errors, you can ignore them.

### Set up Infura and link the endpoints to the Ropsten test network

The [Infura](https://infura.io/?azure-portal=true) development suite provides instant, scalable API access to the Ethereum networks. Infura is a hosted Ethereum node cluster that gives users the ability to run an application on a public network. Use Infura to deploy to and interact with public networks.

To set an account, go to the [Infura website](http://www.infura.io/?azure-portal=true) and follow these steps:

1. Set up an account and confirm your email address.
1. Select **Ethereum** > **Create new project**. Name the project *TodoList*.
1. Under **Keys**, change the endpoint to **Ropsten**.

Your view should look similar to the following test project:

:::image type="content" source="../media/infura-test-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the process of creating an Infura project.":::

## Connect to Ropsten

Return to the *todolist* project folder in Visual Studio Code.

1. In the Truffle configuration file, *./truffle-config.js*, uncomment the lines for `hdwallet-provider`, `infuraKey`, `fs`, and `mnemonic`:

    ```javascript
     const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');
     const infuraKey = "fj4jll3k.....";

     const fs = require('fs');
     const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();
    ```

1. Go to your Infura account to get the `infuraKey` value. In Infura, it's called the **Project ID**. It's visible in the Ropsten endpoint:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/infurakey.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Ropsten endpoint to copy.":::

1. Next to **Project ID**, select the clipboard icon to copy the ID. Return to *./truffle-config.js* to paste in the `infuraKey` value. 

    The following image shows an example key to paste. While the example key can be used as a placeholder, your key will be different than the one you see here, and you should use your own infuraKey.

    ```javascript
    const infuraKey = "f6bfe21890a84b9fa27def74bafb0b1b";
    ```

1. Create a file called *.secret*. Copy your mnemonic to the new file. 

    To get your mnemonic, in MetaMask, go to **Settings** > **Security & Privacy**. Select **Reveal Seed Phrase**. Enter your MetaMask password to verify your identity. Then select **Copy to clipboard**.

    >[!Important]
    >Don't share your mnemonic with anyone, or they could access your account. If you use Git, make sure to include *.secret* in your *.gitignore* file.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/reveal-metamask-seed-phrase.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to reveal a seed phrase in MetaMask.":::

1. Use the following code to read the seed phrase from the *.secret* file and to trim all the white spaces:

    ```javascript
    const mnemonic = fs.readFileSync(".secret").toString().trim();
    ```

1. Define the network by uncommenting the Ropsten network settings in *truffle-config.js*. Make sure that your configuration looks like this code:

    ```javascript
    ropsten: {
       provider: () => new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/${infuraKey}`),
       network_id: 3,       // Ropsten's id
       gas: 5500000,        // Ropsten has a lower block limit than mainnet
       confirmations: 2,    // # of confs to wait between deployments. (default: 0)
       timeoutBlocks: 200,  // # of blocks before a deployment times out (minimum/default: 50)
       skipDryRun: true     // Skip dry run before migrations? (default: false for public nets )
     },
    ```

## Deploy to Ropsten

To deploy to Ropsten, run the following command from the Visual Studio Code terminal: 

```truffle migrate --network ropsten```

If your connection is successful, you'll see the following output:

```output

## Verify deployment of the contract

Follow the steps in the next sections to verify that your contract was deployed.
### Verify in MetaMask

Check MetaMask to verify that ether was used to deploy the contract.

:::image type="content" source="../media/metamask-balance-after-deploy-ropsten.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the MetaMask balance after deployment to Ropsten.":::

### Verify in Ropsten Etherscan

In Ropsten Etherscan, enter the contract address. Then inspect your contract.

:::image type="content" source="../media/ropsten-etherscan-with-deployed-contract.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the contract deployed in Etherscan.":::

You can also verify your deployment by opening a new terminal window within Visual Studio Code. You interact with your contract by using the Truffle console like you do on the Ganache development blockchain.
