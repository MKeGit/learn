quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What are smart contracts?"
    choices:
    - content: "Programs that only send cryptocurrency."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Smart contracts are used for much more than cryptocurrency."
    - content: "Programs that only generate and send tokens."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tokens are often associated with smart contracts, but smart contracts focus on more than just tokens."
    - content: "Programs that are stored inside a blockchain. They represent an agreement between parties that are sending digital assets."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Smart contracts are stored inside blockchains. They can represent the transfer of any digital asset."
    - content: "Programs that are stored outside a blockchain. They must be signed by parties that are sending digital assets."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Almost there. Smart contracts are stored *inside* blockchains. They are not stored externally."  

  - content: "When a new project is created by using the Truffle for VS Code extension, what gets automatically generated?"
    choices:
    - content: "A sample contract file written in Solidity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A contracts directory is generated, and it contains a couple of contracts. But this directory isn't the only automatically generated content."
    - content: "A build folder and files to compile and deploy the Solidity project"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A build folder is generated only after the project is compiled."
    - content: "Folders for contracts, migrations, and tests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. All of these folders are in fact generated, but there are also files within each of the folders created."
    - content: "A sample contract, migration, a test, and a Truffle config file."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A new project generates a HelloBlockchain contract, a migration, a test, and a Truffle config file. You can build on these examples to create your own smart contract projects."

  - content: "What is Truffle?"
    choices:
    - content: "A command-line tool that you can use to create smart contracts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite. This answer describes one part of what Truffle can do. But Truffle can do more than just create smart contracts. Truffle is typically not described as a command-line tool."
    - content: "A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Truffle is a development framework that helps you manage smart contracts, from creation to testing to deployment."
    - content: "A personal blockchain Ethereum development tool that you can use to deploy contracts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer best describes Ganache. Ganache is a tool in the Truffle Suite. You use it to view activities in your blockchain."
    - content: "A library that you can use to write blockchain applications"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This answer describes Drizzle. Drizzle is a tool in the Truffle Suite that you can use to create decentralized applications."
