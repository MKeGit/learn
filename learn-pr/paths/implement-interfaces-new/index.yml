prerequisites: |
  - Visual Studio Code installed with th3 C# Dev Kit
  - Basic knowledge of the Visual Studio Code IDE
  - Basic understanding of the C# programming language
  - Familiarity with classes
summary: |
  Interfaces provide a contract defines what properties and methods implementing classes must&nbsp;provide, but now how. You design interfaces with properties and methods and develop classes that implement the interfaces.&nbsp;Discover how default implementations in interfaces enable you to add new methods directly into an interface and provide a default implementation. Reduce code dependencies using interfaces&nbsp;and use explicit interface members, and multiple interfaces to further add resilience and flexibility to code.
