title: Create intelligent health bots with Azure Health Bot
summary: |
  Azure Health Bot enables users to build a health bot by using built-in or custom scenarios. The information that each instance of the Health Bot service handles is privacy protected to HIPAA standards. It also meets Microsoft's high standards for privacy and security.

  The modules in this Learning path guide you through the creation of both a basic and enhanced health bot. You'll learn about language understanding and how to use both built-in and template scenarios.
