title: Distributed programming on the cloud
summary: |
  Learn about how complex computer programs must be architected for the cloud by using distributed programming.

  In this learning path, you'll:
    - Classify programs as sequential, concurrent, parallel, and distributed
    - Indicate why programmers usually parallelize sequential programs
    - Define distributed programming models
    - Discuss the challenges with scalability, communication, heterogeneity, synchronization, fault tolerance, and scheduling that are encountered when building cloud programs
    - Define heterogeneous and homogenous clouds, and identify the main reasons for heterogeneity in the cloud
    - List the main challenges that heterogeneity poses on distributed programs, and outline some strategies for how to address such challenges
    - State when and why synchronization is required in the cloud
    - Identify the main technique that can be used to tolerate faults in clouds
    - Outline the difference between task scheduling and job scheduling
    - Explain how heterogeneity and locality can influence task schedulers

  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
