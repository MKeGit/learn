prerequisites: |
  Before starting this learning path, you should already have:
  *   To complete the later modules in the learning path, you need access to Azure OpenAI studio, which can take several days to be approved. If you need access, apply through the [**Azure OpenAI limited access**](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?azure-portal=true) page.
  *   Familiarity with Azure and the Azure portal.
  *   Experience programming with Python or Node.js.
  If you have no previous programming experience, we recommend you complete the [Introduction to Node.js](/training/modules/intro-to-nodejs/) or [Python for beginners](/training/paths/beginner-python/) learning path before starting this one.
