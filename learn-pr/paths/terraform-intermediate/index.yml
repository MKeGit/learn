title: Intermediate Terraform on Azure
summary: |
  Terraform enables you to deploy Azure resources. Terraform uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Terraform provides a concise syntax and type safety for your Azure infrastructure declarations.

  THIS LEARNING PATH IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. CHECK BACK SOON FOR UPDATES.

  Each module in this learning path provides examples for use with the Azure CLI. Visual Studio Code is used to write and validate your Terraform code.
