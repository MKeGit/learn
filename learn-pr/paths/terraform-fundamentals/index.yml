title: Fundamentals of Terraform on Azure
summary: |
  Terraform enables you to deploy Azure resources. Terraform uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code.
  Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your
  deployments more consistent and repeatable.

  Terraform provides a concise syntax and type safety for your Azure infrastructure declarations.

  Take this learning path to get started with Terraform. In it, you'll:

  * Decide whether Terraform is the right choice for your deployments to Azure.
  * Understand Terraform's declarative syntax and the structure of a Terraform module.
  * Apply Terraform features such as variables, outputs, functions, and loops to control how your infrastructure is deployed.
  * Define modules that break down complex deployments into smaller reusable components.

  Each module in this learning path provides examples for use with the Azure CLI. Visual Studio Code is used to write and validate your Terraform code.
