You can use Microsoft Intune to manage the devices and apps that your company's workforce uses. At times, you'll need to verify the health of these devices and apps. Fortunately, there are a number of resources you can use to resolve compliance issues for end user's devices and apps, as well as your tenant.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. You have multiple issues that you must check. First, you need to make sure your tenant is running successfully. Next, you need to troubleshoot why an individual end user is having device compliance issues. Third, you want to get an overall enrollment status report of all the end users for your tenant.

Microsoft Intune provides the tools, reports, and resources you need to confirm the state of your Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security solution. This module will provide details about each of the preceding resources.
