Microsoft Intune reports allow you to more effectively and proactively monitor the health and activity of endpoints across your organization, and also provides other reporting data across Intune. For example, you can see reports about device compliance, device health, and device trends. In addition, you can create custom reports to obtain more specific data. 

The report types are organized into the following focus areas:

- **Operational**: Provides timely, targeted data that helps you focus and take action. Admins, subject matter experts, and helpdesk will find these reports most helpful.
- **Organizational**: Provides a broader summary of an overall view, such as device management state. Managers and admins will find these reports most helpful.
- **Historical**: Provides patterns and trends over a period of time. Managers and admins will find these reports most helpful.
- **Specialist**: Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports. Admins will find these reports most helpful.
