As part of the Tenant Status dashboard, you can view details for *Service incidents* that affect your tenant and *Intune news* that provides information about updates and planned changes.

## Intune service health

View details for active incidents and advisories without having to navigate to the Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard or the Message Center (both of which are located in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/about-the-admin-center?azure-portal=true)). Only incidents that affect your tenant are shown under the **Intune service health** section of the **Service health and message center** tab.
