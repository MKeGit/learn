As we mentioned, Conditional Access makes sure that only trusted users can access organizational resources on trusted devices using trusted apps. It's built from scratch in the cloud. Whether you're managing devices with Intune or extending your Configuration Manager deployment with co-management, it works the same way.

For example, Conditional Access allows you to control the devices and apps that can connect to your email. Conditional Access provides granular access control to keep your corporate data secure while giving end users an experience that allows them to do their best work from any device. In fact, you can define conditions that gate access to your corporate data based on location, device, user state, and application sensitivity.

Conditional Access is a Microsoft Entra capability that's included with a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license. Intune enhances this capability by adding mobile device compliance and mobile app management to the solution.
