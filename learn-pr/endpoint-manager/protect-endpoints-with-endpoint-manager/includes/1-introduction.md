Microsoft Intune helps you protect the digital resources that your organization uses. These resources include devices, apps, and data. You can protect these resources based on their settings. To configure the settings, you use the Microsoft Intune admin center. Those settings are contained in policies that you create and apply to your organization's devices, apps, and users. You can assign these policies to your entire organization or to groups that you define, and those groups can be either users or devices.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. Your company requires that each device must use a PIN to access the device as an extra safety requirement. This requirement must be implemented for all devices that access your corporate network, whether the device is company owned or personally owned. Also, you need to be able to reset the PINs when users are locked out of their devices. You plan to use Microsoft Intune to add this capability as a requirement to all devices that access organization data. Any device that doesn't accept this requirement isn't permitted to access your company's data.

Here, you'll learn how you can use Intune configuration policies to manage and protect devices, apps, and data.
