When you're working on founding an early-stage startup, you might wonder:

- What it's really like to found a startup.
- How to manage your time and energy.
- When to transition to building your business full time.

This module expands on these concepts and covers practical tips for building a high-performing startup team. It also discusses steps that you can take to more easily manage your team as it grows and to set up your company for success.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll learn:

- The core attributes and skill sets that make up successful startup teams.
- The pros and cons of cofounders versus employees versus contractors.
- How to use founder vesting to align interests and optimize retention.
- Why inclusive hiring is a huge strategic advantage.
- How to use mentors to augment the capabilities of your core team.
- How to find the help that you need through the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub mentor network and your local community.

> [!NOTE]
> Every startup is different, and every founder has their own unique perspective. This module will discuss principles that apply broadly rather than try to be prescriptive about what your startup team should look like or how you should go about building it.
