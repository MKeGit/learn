In this module, we outlined some steps for identifying a good name for your startup, and described how to use this name as the foundation for a strong company brand. We used eight startup naming principles as a guide to help you choose a good name for your company. 

Here's a summary of what you learned:

- It's easy to pick a suboptimal name for your company. Poor naming is unlikely to doom your company, but it can create friction and make it harder for potential customers to find you. It can also affect the credibility of your company's brand.
- Your company's name is one of the few things that you control completely, so try to get it right.
- One of the key intellectual property assets that your company should own if you aspire to be a global company, is the domain *\<your-company-name\>.com*.
- The best time to change your company name is *now* if you decide to do it. Making a change is never easy, but the longer you wait, the more difficult and expensive it is.
- Every startup founder should invest time in building their personal brand as a business leader and as the external face of their company. A strong personal brand adds credibility to your company's brand.
- Customers, investors, and future employees are seeking authentic communications from companies. Having a founder as the primary spokesperson for a company makes it easier for people to relate.
