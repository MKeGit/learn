Now, let's put all of the pieces together and schedule a time to meet with your mentor. Just as important, take time to ensure that the mentor is as prepared for the meeting as you are.

## Step 1: Introduce yourself

&#9744; Revisit your research to ensure you understand the mentor's relevant experience.\
&#9744; Compose an email that provides a quick description of your company—either as an introduction or as a reminder—and outlines the discussion you're hoping to have with the mentor.\
&#9744; Request windows of availability or ask for access to their preferred scheduling assistant.

## Step 2: Establish a time and location

Once your mentor responds, find a time and location that works for both of you, and for the format and timing of the meeting.

&#9744; Pick a time that provides you with adequate time before and after the meeting, but that falls within the mentor's available time.\
&#9744; Send a calendar invite or use the mentors preferred scheduling tool.\
&#9744; Share a draft of the agenda you've created for the meeting and ask for edits/additions from the mentor.\
&#9744; Include any attachments or links to required materials to prepare for the meeting.\
&#9744; If the meeting is in person, ensure that directions are provided.\
&#9744; Block an additional 30-60 minutes on your personal calendar immediately following your mentor meeting to ensure that you have time to process the content from the meeting.

## Step 3: Confirm the meeting

Finally, the day before, ensure that both you and the mentor are prepared for the meeting.

&#9744; Send a personal reminder.\
&#9744; Ask if the mentor needs to reschedule.\
&#9744; Include a revised agenda with relevant attachments or links.\
&#9744; Confirm the location of the meeting.\
&#9744; Even if it's a virtual meeting, provide phone/text information in case anything changes at the last minute or the mentor has difficulty joining the meeting/finding you.
