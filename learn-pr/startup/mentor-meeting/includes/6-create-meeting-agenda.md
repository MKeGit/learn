Now that you have a clear objective that aligns with your needs and your mentor's expertise, let's focus on the intended outcome of the first meeting. To achieve that outcome, it's important to create an agenda that ensures that you're making the best use of the mentor's time.

It's your responsibility to manage the meeting, from setting the agenda to driving the dynamics of the meeting itself. The more structure you're able to bring to the meeting, the more effective the meeting with the mentor will be.

If this is the first time you're meeting this mentor, make sure to propose adequate time for introductions. Unlike working with an expert on a problem, your first meeting with a mentor should serve as an opportunity for learning more about one another. Gaining more details about the mentor and their experience helps you better facilitate future meetings, and the mentor learning more about you and your company ensures that they have the context they need for providing feedback.

Sometimes, the first meeting with a new mentor is consumed with simply getting to know one another. This context can be critical for the ongoing relationship, so it's important to spend that time to get acquainted. Don't worry if you're not able to cover every agenda item. It's more important that the first meeting sets a tone and establishes a basis for future meetings with the mentor.

If you already know the mentor or this is a subsequent meeting, provide time at the outset of the meeting to recap the previous meeting and any tasks you or the mentor had from the previous meeting.

A sample agenda for a 30-minute meeting could look like this:

- 2:30 PM - Review agenda and recap previous meeting/tasks
- 2:35 PM - Walk through the financial model
- 2:45 PM - Discuss the current model and suggested changes/additions
- 2:55 PM - Establish tasks and tentative timing for the next meeting
- 2:59 PM - Meeting ends
