One of the most important things for founders to remember when meeting with mentors is that founders own the meeting. That means that you have the responsibility of driving the meeting, keeping track of time, managing the agenda, and getting everyone out of the meeting on time.

Here are some tips to ensure that you do an effective job of managing your meeting with your mentor:

* Arrive early, even if it's a virtual meeting. Make sure that you have plenty of cushion on either side of your mentor meeting. You're going to want to be there early so that the meeting can start on time. You also don't want to feel like you have to cut a conversation short if you and your mentor are in the depths of a discussion.

* If you're in a conference room or online call that involves sharing materials like spreadsheets or screens, test to make sure that you're able to do so ahead of time. You only have a short amount of time with your mentor, and technical difficulties can waste that important time.

* If the meeting takes place at a coffee shop or restaurant, offer to pick up the tab before the meeting starts. Remember that your mentor is volunteering their time to provide invaluable insights for you and your company. If you're in a position to pay for a coffee or food, offer to do so. It's a reminder to your mentor that their time is valued.

* Ask if it's acceptable to record the meeting or opt to take copious notes. It's important to capture as much detail from the meeting as possible. If recording is an option that's acceptable, take advantage of that. Otherwise, make sure to take notes on the meeting, capturing insights, tasks, and future topics for conversation.

* Drive the meeting. Once the meeting starts, the onus is on you to drive the meeting toward the outcomes you're expecting to achieve. Use your agenda as a tool to keep things on track, but also feel free to deviate from plan if you enter territory where you're getting valuable insights from the mentor. First and foremost, it's imperative that the meeting feels valuable for both your mentor and you, so use your judgment on how to best make that happen.

* Before the close, ask the mentor if it's acceptable to share ongoing progress with your company. As you begin to meet with mentors and other individuals who can be helpful, it's important to begin a regular cadence of updates that keep everyone apprised of the progress you're making with your startup, and areas where they can be helpful. Even if you haven't started an update regimen, ask the mentor if they are okay with being added to the distribution list.

* Thank the mentor for their time. To reiterate, your mentor is volunteering their time to provide you with free advice and insights. They're going out of their way to "pay it forward" for you and other entrepreneurs. Please take the opportunity to thank the mentor, even if the feedback they provided was critical or divergent from your expectations. It's people like your mentor who will ultimately help you build the company you want to build.

Once the meeting concludes, it's time to follow up with your mentor.
