The goal of this module was to outline the process of raising money from investors to fund the growth of your startup. We covered the following points:

- Not all startups need to raise external capital. Think through the implications of self-funding, or *bootstrapping*, versus external funding.
- Not all startups can raise capital. Many founders underestimate the rate of growth and scale they need to achieve in order to generate an acceptable return to investors.
- Investors view startups through the lens of their investment portfolio. They only invest in startups that can generate a return that makes up for all the companies in their portfolio that don't succeed.
- Most investors don't invest in ideas. They look for traction as evidence that the business is meeting a customer need. The best form of traction is profit, followed by revenue, and then customer engagement.
- It's important to understand different types of investors and the nonfinancial value they bring. A good rule of thumb for choosing investors: Smart, involved money > Dumb, passive money > Dumb, involved money.
- Raising a funding round requires strategic decisions about which investors to approach, and in which order. Most successful funding rounds involve pitching several investors in parallel.
- To close a funding round, you need to be ready for due diligence. You can streamline this process by preparing a data room in advance.
