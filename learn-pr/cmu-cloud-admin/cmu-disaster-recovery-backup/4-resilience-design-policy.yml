  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "What is the primary purpose of resilience in information systems?"
      choices:
      - content: "To ensure that all data, whether stored on-premises or in the cloud, is backed up and ready to be restored if an unplanned failure occurs"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Backup and replication are elements that contribute to resilience, but backups alone do not make systems resilient."
      - content: "To ensure that systems can scale to meet demand when demand spikes unexpectedly"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This is a description of elasticity, not resilience."
      - content: "To reduce the cost of maintaining failover clusters, which typically aren't used unless an unplanned failure occurs"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Resiliency typically increases costs by maintaining replicas of the resources that comprise a system."
      - content: "To maintain acceptable service levels even when unplanned failures occur"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! A system that fails over to a secondary set of resources when primary resources go down is a resilient system."
    
    - content: "True or false: Hosting an application on a resilient cloud platform makes the application resilient, too"
      choices:
      - content: "True"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Applications must be designed for resiliency, even if they're hosted on resilient cloud platforms."
      - content: "False"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Applications must be designed for resiliency, even if they're hosted on resilient cloud platforms."
