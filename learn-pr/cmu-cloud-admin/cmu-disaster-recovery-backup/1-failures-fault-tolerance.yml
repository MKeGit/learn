  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following test scenarios will not help test the resiliency and readiness of a cloud service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Randomly turning off VM instances that make up the service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Randomly turning off VM instances that make up the service will help in testing the resiliency and readiness of a cloud service, but what else will?"
    - content: "Turning off an entire data center or availability zone"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Turning off an entire data center or availability zone will help in testing the resiliency and readiness of a cloud service, but what else will?"
    - content: "Randomly deleting the files that back up the production database of the main web server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Randomly deleting the files that back up the production database of the main web server will help in testing the resiliency and readiness of a cloud service, but what else will?"
    - content: "All of these tests ensure the resiliency of the cloud service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "An organization deploys a solution consisting of a Web site and a database to the cloud. It also deploys a replica solution to take over in the event that the primary solution fails. In the background, each request that reaches the primary Web site is forwarded to (and also processed by) the secondary Web site. Responses from the secondary site are ignored, while responses from the primary site are transmitted back to the client. While no attempt is made to synchronize the actions of the primary site and its replica, the intent is to make sure that the secondary database mirrors the primary database as closely as possible. Which resource replication strategy does this represent?"
    choices:
    - content: "Active replication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Active replication would synchronize the actions of the primary and secondary sites."
    - content: "Semi-active replication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Passive replication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Passive replication would attempt to constantly replicate the database rather than forward requests to the secondary site."
    - content: "Semi-passive replication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Semi-passive replication would attempt to constantly replicate the database rather than forward requests to the secondary site, and it would make no distinction between primaries and secondaries."
