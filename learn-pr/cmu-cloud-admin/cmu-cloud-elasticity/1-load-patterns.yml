  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "Assume one server can handle 5,000 requests per unit of time, and a web site experiences loads that vary relatively evenly from a low of 5,000 to a peak of 25,000. The site is hosted in the cloud using virtual machines and each VM costs $4 per day. What is the approximate annual difference in cost between providing elastic capacity that is sized to meet demand and constant capacity sized to handle peak loads?"
      choices:
      - content: "$600"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. If the average capacity is 15,000 requests per unit time and peak is 25,000, then the difference equates to two servers. (2 servers) X ($4/day) X (365 days/year) = $2,920."
      - content: "$1,240"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. If the average capacity is 15,000 requests per unit time and peak is 25,000, then the difference equates to two servers. (2 servers) X ($4/day) X (365 days/year) = $2,920."
      - content: "$2,920"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! If the average capacity is 15,000 requests per unit time and peak is 25,000, then the difference equates to two servers. (2 servers) X ($4/day) X (365 days/year) = $2,920."
      - content: "$4,680"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. If the average capacity is 15,000 requests per unit time and peak is 25,000, then the difference equates to two servers. (2 servers) X ($4/day) X (365 days/year) = $2,920."
