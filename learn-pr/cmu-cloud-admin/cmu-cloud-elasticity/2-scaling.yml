  questions:

    - content: "Which of the following choices is NOT one of the benefits of scaling when scaling is done well?"
      choices:
      - content: "Reduced resource cost (compared to provisioning for peak utilization)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Reduced resource cost is one of the benefits of scalability."
      - content: "Less complexity in deployment"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Scaling doesn't reduce the complexity of the system."
      - content: "Stable performance regardless of the load on the system"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Stable performance is one of the benefits of scalability."
      - content: "Fewer failures because of overwhelming the capacity of a single resource"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Fewer failures is one of the benefits of scalability."

    - content: "Which of the following choices is a benefit of horizontal scaling compared to vertical scaling?"
      choices:
      - content: "Higher availability"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Higher availability is one benefit of horizontal scaling, but it's not the only one."
      - content: "Higher granularity in scaling"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Higher granularity is one benefit of horizontal scaling, but it's not the only one."
      - content: "Zero down-time as scaling occurs"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Zero down-time as scaling occurs is one benefit of horizontal scaling, but it's not the only one."
      - content: "All of the above"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! All three are reasons that horizontal scaling is more popular than vertical scaling in the cloud."
