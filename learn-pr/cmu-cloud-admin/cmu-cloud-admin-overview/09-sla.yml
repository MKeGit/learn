  questions:

    - content: "Microsoft offers customers a 10% service credit if the monthly up-time for an Azure App Service falls below 99.95%. Assuming a month is 31 days long, how many minutes must an App Service be down in one month to trigger a credit?"
      choices:
      - content: "11 minutes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The answer is (31 * 24 * 60) * 0.0005."
      - content: "22 minutes"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! The answer is (31 * 24 *60) * 0.0005 = 22 minutes."
      - content: "33 minutes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The answer is (31 * 24 * 60) * 0.0005."
      - content: "44 minutes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The answer is (31 * 24 * 60) * 0.0005."
  
    - content: "Suppose you build a solution consisting of two interconnected cloud services, each of which comes with an SLA guaranteeing that the service will be up at least 99.50% of the time. What is the expected minimum up-time for the solution as a whole?"
      choices:
      - content: "99.75%"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Given that the solution is 'down' if either service is unavailable, the combined up-time must be less than the individual up-times."
      - content: "99.50%"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Given that the solution is 'down' if either service is unavailable, the combined up-time must be less than the individual up-times."
      - content: "99.00%"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! The up-time for the solution is the product of the up-times for the individual services that comprise it."
      - content: "95.20%"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Given that the solution is 'down' if either service is unavailable, the combined up-time must be less than the individual up-times."
