  questions:

    - content: "Customer relationship management (CRM) software is an example of what layer in the Cloud Building Blocks?"
      choices:
      - content: "Application Software"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "Development Platforms"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. CRM software delivered as a service sits higher in the stack."
      - content: "Resource Sharing"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. CRM software delivered as a service sits higher in the stack."
      - content: "Infrastructure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. CRM software delivered as a service sits higher in the stack."
      
    - content: "Virtualization software is an example of what layer in the Cloud Building Blocks?"
      choices: 
      - content: "Application Software"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization software sits lower in the stack."
      - content: "Development Platforms"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization software sits lower in the stack."
      - content: "Resource Sharing"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "Infrastructure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization software sits higher in the stack."

    - content: "A virtual machine is an example of which cloud service model?"
      choices:
      - content: "Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! A virtual machine is a canonical example of virtualized computing infrastructure."
      - content: "Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machines are frequently used in PaaS solutions but are not themselves considered PaaS."
      - content: "Software-as-a-service (SaaS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machines are frequently used in PaaS solutions but are not themselves considered SaaS."
      - content: "None of the above"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect."
    
    - content: "Which of the following is considered to be a characteristic of IaaS?"
      choices:
      - content: "IaaS providers do not allow clients to scale resources on demand"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. IaaS providers allow clients to scale resources up or down to meet demand."
      - content: "IaaS providers provide computing resources such as virtual machines to customers as a service"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Virtual networks are also examples of IaaS."
      - content: "Users are aware of whom they share physical resources with"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. IaaS cloud providers do not indicate how the resources are shared among multiple users."
      - content: "Users are not responsible for patching and maintaining the operating system"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Once a virtual machine is created, it is the user's responsibility to keep it up to date."

    - content: "Google App Engine (GAE) is an example of PaaS. Which of the following statements about GAE is incorrect?"
      choices:
      - content: "Applications deployed on GAE can dynamically scale to meet demand"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. PaaS offers built-in scaling mechanisms that are automatically handled by the cloud provider."
      - content: "Customers have the flexibility to decide the number and configuration of physical servers required for hosting a GAE application"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! The user does not have the flexibility to decide the number of physical servers required for hosting an application; the cloud provider makes this decision."
      - content: "GAE provides customers with web-based tools for using and configuring the platform"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This statement is correct because PaaS providers offer web-based tools for managing PaaS deployments."
      - content: "GAE handles the patching and maintenance of the underlying operating system"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. One of the principles of PaaS is that the cloud service provider handles operating-system maintenance."

    - content: "Cloud service providers offers function runtimes such as Azure Functions for executing code that you upload to the cloud in a serverless environment. To which service model do function runtimes belong?"
      choices:
      - content: "Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Function runtimes utilize virtual machines under the hood, but they are not IaaS."
      - content: "Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Function runtimes are generally considered to be PaaS services."
      - content: "Software-as-a-service (SaaS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Function runtimes are considered platforms, not software-as-a-service."
      - content: "None of the above"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect."

    - content: "Which of the following tasks is the best fit for Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions?"
      choices:
      - content: "Hosting a web site that can automatically scale up and down as traffic to the site fluctuates"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Functions are ideal for tasks that run relatively infrequently or for short periods of time, not for applications that run 24/7."
      - content: "Training machine-learning models that require substantial amounts of compute power"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. While most functions do offer limited scalability, they are not a substitute for HPC clusters."
      - content: "Delivering software such as Microsoft 365 and Google Docs over the web"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Functions are ideal for tasks that run relatively infrequently or for short periods of time, not for applications that run 24/7."
      - content: "Performing nightly backups or weekly billing operations"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Tasks that occur relatively infrequently or run for short periods of time are ideal candidates for functions because most function runtimes support a consumption model that only charges you while a function is executing."
