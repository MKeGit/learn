  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "When did the general ideas about cloud computing and utility computing emerge?"
    choices:
    - content: "Between 1950 and 1966"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The idea of utility computing emerged in the 1950s and 1960s when mainframes were prevalent and expensive, and computer engineers were figuring out ways to share a mainframe among multiple users (such as time sharing). The idea of utility computing is mainly attributed to Professor John McCarthy in the 1960s."
    - content: "Between 1995 and 2000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. The ideas behind utility computing have been around since much earlier than that."
    - content: "Between 2006 and the present"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not quite right. The ideas behind utility computing have been around since much earlier than that."

  - content: "Which of the following did NOT contribute significantly to the rise of cloud computing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Privacy regulations passed by governmental entities"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The rise of cloud computing predates privacy regulations such as GDPR."
    - content: "Emergence of high-speed and ubiquitous networking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. High-speed networking allows data to move more quickly to and from the cloud and within the cloud."
    - content: "Rapid growth of the World Wide Web"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The explosive growth of the web fueled the need for super-scalable systems."
    - content: "Virtualization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machines are the backbone of cloud computing and are only possible because of virtualization."
  
  - content: "Which technology enables multiple servers to be consolidated into one physical server?"
    choices:
    - content: "Distributed computing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Distributed computing allows processing tasks to be shared among several computers."
    - content: "Parallel processing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Internet does enable fast, efficient communication between connected devices, but parallel processing doesn't help consolidate multiple servers into one."
    - content: "Virtualization"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Virtualization is the primary enabler for server consolidation, enabling one physical machine to host several virtual machines."
    - content: "Grid computing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Grid computing consolidates a large number of computers as a distributed system to allow the execution of large compute problems."
