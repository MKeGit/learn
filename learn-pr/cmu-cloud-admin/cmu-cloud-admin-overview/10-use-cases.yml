  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "Which of the following scenarios is NOT one that lends itself to a cloud-computing solution?"
      choices:
      - content: "You work at an animation firm that uses banks of servers equipped with GPUs to render scenes for movies."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This is a great application for high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, which can be created in the cloud in a matter of minutes and deleted when they're no longer needed."
      - content: "You are training a convolutional neural network with tens of thousands of images to enable it to determine whether scanned documents contain redactions."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Training a convolutional neural network from scratch requires vast amounts of compute power, something that the cloud provides ready access to."
      - content: "You want to consolidate unused bandwidth on thousands of personal computers and lease it to customers."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Cloud providers do not offer services for consolidating unused bandwidth on personal computers."
      - content: "Your company has terabytes of data that it wishes to archive in at least two geographic locations to minimize the chance of losing the data."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The cloud is a great place to archive data, and most cloud providers offer options for geo-redundant storage."
      - content: "Your company runs an online retail operation in which demand varies at different times of day and different times of year."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The cloud offers PaaS services for hosting web sites that can scale up and down as demand fluctuates, ensuring that you always have enough servers to handle the load."
      - content: "The marketing department has asked you to write an application that uses AI to monitor Twitter and alert them if tweets targeting the company turn negative."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Cloud services such as Azure Text Analytics offer APIs that make it easy to build apps that analyze text for sentiment and perform other AI-related tasks."
