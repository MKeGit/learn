Here is a brief summary of the important concepts learned in this module:

- Securing access to resources, whether on-premises or in the cloud, requires us to identify the users accessing those resources.

- For authenticating web-site users, relying on a trusted third-party identity provider offers a number of advantages over implementing authentication yourself. Among those advantages are tighter security, support for single sign-on (SSO), and reduced development time.

- With third-party identity providers, user credentials are stored by the provider and are never seen by the application.

- Cloud service providers offer identity-provider services, as do popular social-media companies such as Facebook and X.

- Identity information regarding users within an organization (for example, a company) are usually stored in directory services such as Active Directory.

- Directory services store identities for users, groups, and applications.

- Federation allows users accessing cloud resources to be authenticated using on-premises directory systems.

- Synchronization allows users accessing cloud resources to be authenticated using cloud-based directory systems whose contents are synced with on-premises directory systems.

- Guest accounts allow users accessing an organization's resources to be authenticated using identities established outside the organization.

- Federation, synchronization, and guest accounts reduce account sprawl and simplify identity management and access control.

- Role-based access control (RBAC) is used to implement identity and access management (IAM) in cloud solutions.

- Roles specify actions that can be performed on resources and are assigned to users and groups.

- Roles can be applied to individual resources, groups of resources, subscriptions, and in some cases, groups of subscriptions. The level at which a role is applied is termed the resource scope.
