  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "Which of the following choices isn't an advantage of using a third-party identity provider for authentication to use web applications?"
      choices:
      - content: "Better application performance"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. There's no guarantee that an application's performance will be improved by using a third-party identity provider. In fact, there are cases where certain activities may be slower, because of the need to contact external services. However performance impact is usually outweighed by the security benefits of this approach."
      - content: "Stronger security"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Stronger security is a benefit of using a third-party identity provider. Implementing an identity service can be complicated, nuanced, and tedious. Large companies can devote significant resources and expertise to ensuring the service is secure, which will increase the overall security of your solution."
      - content: "Support for single sign-on"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Single sign-on is a benefit of using a third-party identity provider. SSO helps reduce the number of accounts and passwords that users need to remember, which can help avoid bad habits like password reuse."
      - content: "Reduced development time"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Reduced development time is a benefit of using a third-party identity provider. Implementing an identity service can be complicated, nuanced, and tedious. Using an existing service will allow the organization the opportunity to focus on implementations more closely aligned with their core mission."
    - content: "Which of the following choices is the key reason for using directory services within an organization?"
      choices:
      - content: "They provide a central repository for identity information on users within an organization."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "They can be extended to allow users to access cloud resources with their on-premises credentials."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. While this is one of many benefits afforded by some directory services, not all organizations who need directory services need cloud access."
      - content: "They allow users to reuse credentials from social-media sites to access corporate resources, reducing account sprawl."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. While some directory services allow integration with third-party identity providers like social media services, the main purpose is to handle internal identities rather than external ones."
      - content: "They allow flexible configurations that can be used to model organizations large and small. "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Most directory services do allow flexible configurations to help the service meet each organization's unique needs. However, this isn't a key reason why an organization would choose to deploy a directory service."
