  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "Which of the following is NOT one of the ways in which cloud computing benefits from virtualization?"
      choices:
      - content: "Increased elasticity"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization supports elasticity by allowing VMs to be provisioned and deprovisioned dynamically in response to changing demand."
      - content: "Improved server utilization"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization increases server utilization by allowing one server to do the work of many."
      - content: "Reduced energy costs and carbon footprint"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Increased server utilization means you need fewer servers to handle a given workload, and fewer servers means less power consumption."
      - content: "Improved memory efficiency by sharing one operating system among multiple VMs"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Every VM runs its own operating system, and VMs cannot share an operating system any more than two physical computers can share one copy of an operating system."
      - content: "Server consolidation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Virtualization supports server consolidation by allowing the work of several physical servers to be done in separate VMs on a single server."
    
    - content: "Which of the following is an example of elasticity?"
      choices:
      - content: "Doubling the number of VMs hosting a web application in order to meet increased demand"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! This is known as scaling out, and the fact that VMs can be created much more quickly than physical servers can be deployed means the cloud can offer much greater elasticity than a data center that eschews virtualization."
      - content: "Increasing the ambient temperature in a data center to reduce cooling costs"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Elasticity refers to scaling resources to meet changing demand."
      - content: "Replacing a PaaS application running Linux with a PaaS application running Windows with zero downtime"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Elasticity refers to scaling resources to meet changing demand."
      - content: None of the above"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Elasticity refers to scaling resources to meet changing demand."

    - content: "Jack unknowingly downloaded malicious code. This code intends to shut down the machine it is running on. Running this code in a virtual machine will impact which of the following?"
      choices:
      - content: "Programs running in the same virtual machine"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Running the malicious code will only affect programs running in the same virtual machine."
      - content: "Programs running in other virtual machines"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Running the malicious code will  only affect programs running in the same virtual machine."
      - content: "The physical machine that hosts the virtual machine"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Running the malicious code will only affect programs running in the same virtual machine, not the physical machine on which the virtual machine is provisioned."
      - content: "All of the above"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Running the malicious code will affect only programs running in the same virtual machine."
