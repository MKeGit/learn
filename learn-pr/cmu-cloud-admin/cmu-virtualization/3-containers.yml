  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    
    - content: "Which of the following statements regarding containers is NOT true?"
      choices:
      - content: "Because containers are smaller than VMs, they start faster, consume fewer resources, and are more easily transported from one server to another"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This statement regarding containers is true."
      - content: "Because containers are smaller than VMs, a server can typically host more containers than it can VMs"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This statement regarding containers is true."
      - content: "Containers permit different operating systems to run side by side on the same computer"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! VMs permit different operating systems to run on the same computer, but containers do not because they use the host's operating system."
      - content: "Containers virtualize the operating system; they do not virtualize hardware"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. This statement regarding containers is true."

    - content: "You are trying to decide whether an application that your company built and wants to replicate should be hosted in a VM or a container. The application is a web application that runs on Linux and Node.js. However, rather than store data in the local file system, the app stores data in Azure Blob Storage. Is this app a candidate for containerization?"
      choices:
      - content: "Yes"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Containerized apps can access other cloud services just as non-containerized apps can."
      - content: "Yes, but only if it is rewritten so that it doesn't rely on Azure Storage"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Containerized apps can access other cloud services just as non-containerized apps can."
      - content: "No"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Containerized apps can access other cloud services just as non-containerized apps can."

    - content: "What is the difference between a container and a container image?"
      choices:
      - content: "A container can run on Linux or Windows, but a container image can only run on Linux"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Container images don't run; they provide a blueprint for running containers."
      - content: "A container is an instance of a container image"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! Containers are created from container images just as VMs are created from virtual-machine images."
      - content: "A container image hosts running applications, while a container provides the manifest that specifies what's loaded into a container image"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Container images don't run; they provide a blueprint for running containers."
      - content: "There is no difference between containers and container images; the terms are synonymous"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Container images provide a blueprint for running containers, while containers host running software."
