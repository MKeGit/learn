  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "What is the primary reason for placing Azure resources in separate network security groups (NSGs)?"
      choices:
      - content: "To perform load balancing between the resources in the NSGs."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. NSGs are an abstraction of firewalls, and two NSGs can have different firewall rules applied."
      - content: "To allow multiple NSGs to share a network interface adapter (NIC)."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. NSGs are an abstraction of firewalls, and two NSGs can have different firewall rules applied."
      - content: "To prevent an application that crashes on a host in one NSG from affecting resources in the other NSGs."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. NSGs are an abstraction of firewalls, and two NSGs can have different firewall rules applied."
      - content: "To apply different firewall rules to each set of resources."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! NSGs are an abstraction of firewalls, and two NSGs can have different firewall rules applied."

    - content: "Azure supports VNet peering for VNets in the same region, and global VNet peering for VNets in different Azure regions. What is the purpose of VNet peering?"
      choices:
        - content: "To connect VNets so together so that they function as one network."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! Once peered, resources in one VNet can be accessed as if they were part of the other VNet."
        - content: "To isolate traffic in one VNet from traffic in the other."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Once peered, resources in one VNet can be accessed as if they were part of the other VNet."
        - content: "To conserve memory by reducing the size of the network routing tables."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Once peered, resources in one VNet can be accessed as if they were part of the other VNet."
        - content: "To ensure that each VNet has its own network security group."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Once peered, resources in one VNet can be accessed as if they were part of the other VNet."
