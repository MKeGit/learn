  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

    - content: "Users are complaining that a Web site you deployed to the cloud has suddenly become very slow. Which of the following metrics might be helpful to you in resolving the problem?"
      choices:
      - content: "Bounce rate (the number of users who visit your site and immediately leave)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Request wait time is a common metric used to determine whether a server is overloaded."
      - content: "Average length of time requests wait in the request queue"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct! If a Web site seems slow, it is often because the Web server is receiving more traffic than it can handle. Request wait time is a common metric used to determine whether a server is overloaded."
      - content: "Average page-load time"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Request wait time is a common metric used to determine whether a server is overloaded. Poor performance can affect page load times, but pages sometimes load quickly even if the server takes a long time to respond to page requests. Page loads don't begin until after the server has responded."
      - content: "Average number of pages visited by each user"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Request wait time is a common metric used to determine whether a server is overloaded."
