  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to install SQL Server on a Linux container. Which is the most straightforward method? Select the best answer."
    choices:
    - content: "Install a SQL Server for Linux container image on any operating system."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Containers use components of the host operating system so you can't install a SQL Server for Linux container image on any operating system."
    - content: "Install a SQL Server for Linux container image on a Linux distribution."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Containers use components of the host operating system and so must use the same operating system as the host. There are container images available that include SQL Server."
    - content: "Install SQL Server for Linux on a container image that runs on Windows."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Containers use components of the host operating system and so must use the same operating system as the host and you can't install SQL Server for Linux on a container image that runs on Windows."
  - content: "By default, which components does SQL Server for Linux include? Select the best answer."
    choices:
    - content: "Database engine"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The default installation only includes the database engine although you can add command-line tools and a graphical tool, where appropriate."
    - content: "Command-line tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The default installation doesn't include command-line tools, although you can add command-line tools where appropriate."
    - content: "Graphical tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The default installation doesn't include graphical tools, although you can add a graphical tool where appropriate." 
  - content: "You want to deploy SQL Server on a container to be hosted in Docker. What's the correct process? Select the best answer."
    choices:
    - content: "Install Docker. It already contains SQL Server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Docker doesn't contain a SQL Server image."
    - content: "Use the sudo zypper install command."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You don't need to install SQL Server on the correct image."
    - content: "Pull and run the SQL Server container image."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To install SQL Server on a container, pull and run the SQL Server image."
