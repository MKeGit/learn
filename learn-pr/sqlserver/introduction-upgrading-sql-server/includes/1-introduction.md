Your organization might have many databases with a complex setup. There could be many database servers running different versions of Microsoft SQL Server. Such environments present complex problems to administrators seeking to ensure their software is up to date.

You're the senior admin working for a long-established law firm. Over the years, the firm has expanded by acquiring smaller companies. Because each company within the group used databases in different ways, you now have to support many versions of SQL Server. Some of these SQL Server installs are old and no longer supported by Microsoft. Crucially, some aren't even in compliance with data-protection legislation in your jurisdiction.

You've decided to upgrade older versions of SQL Server. You want to use the best tools to upgrade your databases with the least impact on business systems and end users.
