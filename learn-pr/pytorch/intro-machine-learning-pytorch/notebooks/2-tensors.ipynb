In fact, tensors and NumPy arrays can often share the same underlying memory address with a capability called `bridge-to-np-label`, which eliminates the need to copy data. Tensors are also optimized for automatic differentiation (we'll see more about that later in the Autograd unit). If you’re familiar with `ndarrays`, you’ll be right at home with the Tensor API.
