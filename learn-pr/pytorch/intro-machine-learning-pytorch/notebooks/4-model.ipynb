The hidden and output layers contain a number of neurons. Neural networks mimic the way a human brain processes information.\n",

    "## Components of a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **activation function** determines whether a neuron should be activated or not. The computations that happen in a neural network include applying an activation function. If a neuron activates, then it means the input is important. There are different kinds of activation functions. The choice of which activation function to use depends on what you want the output to be. Another important role of an activation function is to add non-linearity to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - _Binary_ is used to set an output node to 1 if the function result is positive and 0 if the function result is zero or negative. $f(x)= {\\small \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if } x < 0\\\\ 1, & \\text{if } x\\geq 0\\\\ \\end{cases}}$\n",
    "    - _Sigmoid_ is used to predict the probability of an output node being between 0 and 1.  $f(x) = {\\large \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}} $\n",
    "    - _Tanh_ is used to predict whether an output node is between 1 and -1, for classification use cases.  $f(x) = {\\large \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}} $\n",
    "    - _ReLU_ (*rectified linear activation function*) is used to set the output node to 0 if the function result is negative and keeps the result value if the result is a positive value.  $f(x)= {\\small \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if } x < 0\\\\ x, & \\text{if } x\\geq 0\\\\ \\end{cases}}$\n",
    "- **Weights** influence how close our network's output is to the expected output value. As an input enters the neuron, it gets multiplied by a weight value, and the resulting output is either observed or passed to the next layer in the neural network. Weights for all neurons in a layer are organized into one tensor.\n",
    "- **Bias** makes up the difference between the activation function's output and its intended output. A low bias suggests that the network is making more assumptions about the output's form, whereas a high bias value makes fewer assumptions about the output's form. \n",
