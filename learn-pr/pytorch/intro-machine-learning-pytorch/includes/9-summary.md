In this module, we introduced the key concepts to building machine-learning models using neural networks, and implemented those concepts with PyTorch. We built an image-recognition model that could classify images such as T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boots.

You learned the following key areas:

- How to use Tensors with CPUs and GPUs
- How to manage, scale, and normalize your datasets
- How to build a model using a neural network
- How to optimize a model
- How to optimize model inference

Happy learning!
