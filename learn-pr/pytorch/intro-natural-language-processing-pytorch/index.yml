title: Introduction to Natural Language Processing with PyTorch
summary: In this module, we will explore different neural network architectures for dealing with natural language texts. In the recent years, **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) has experienced fast growth primarily due to the performance of the language modelsâ€™ ability to accurately "understand" human language faster while using unsupervised training on large text corpora. We will learn about different NLP techniques such as using bag-of-words (BoW), word embeddings and recurrent neural networks for classifying text from news headlines to one of the 4 categories (World, Sports, Business and Sci-Tech).
