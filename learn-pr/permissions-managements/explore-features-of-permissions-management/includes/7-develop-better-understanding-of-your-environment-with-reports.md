If you find youâ€™re still looking for certain information not found in these reports, Permissions Management gives you the ability to create custom reports. You can customize reports based on the specific information you want, and you can schedule the reports to be emailed to you on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. 

All reports generated by Permissions Management (both system reports and custom reports) are exportable in one of three formats: CSV, XLSX, or PDF.
