Alerts within Permissions Management give you the insight to continuously monitor your environment and take a proactive approach to preventing permissions creep. Alerts are also useful for threat detection and managing insider risk. 

There are four main types of alerts that can be created/configured within Entra Permissions Management: 
- Activity alerts 
- Rule-Based Anomaly alerts 
- Statistical Anomaly alerts 
- Permission Analytics alerts 

### Activity alerts
With Activity alerts, you create alerts based on activity that is happening in your environment. For example, you can be alerted every time a specific resource in your environment is accessed or every time a certain task is performed.

Activity alerts are the most customizable and allow you to build out your alert criteria using an easy-to-use, no code interface.

> [!Tip]
> Activity alerts are useful for monitoring specific identities or resources. For example, you can set up activity alerts to notify you every time one of your critical resources is accessed. 

### Rule-Based Anomaly alerts
Rule-Based Anomaly alerts are a set of prebuilt alerts that allow you to be notified of activity that is happening for the first time in your environment. For example, you can be alerted every time a resource is accessed for the first time or every time a user performs a task for the first time.

> [!Tip]
> Rule-Based Anomaly alerts are useful for threat detection, as identities performing specific tasks or accessing certain resources for the first time could be a red flag that a bad actor might be at play.  
 
### Statistical Anomaly alerts
Statistical Anomaly alerts take advantage of Permissions Managementâ€™s AI and ML capabilities. Based on prior activity log information, Permissions Management classifies and determines what is considered normal behavior for each one of your identities. You then choose from a set of prebuilt alerts that alert you to any abnormal or suspicious activity in your environment. For example, you can be notified whenever an identity performs a high number of tasks or when an identity performs tasks at an unusual time of the day.

> [!Tip] 
> Statistical Anomaly alerts are useful for threat detection, as unusual activity in your environment can be a sign of a compromised account. 

### Permissions Analytics alerts
Permissions Analytics alerts are tied to the Permissions Analytics Report and each prebuilt alert is tied to a specific category listed in the report. For example, you can be notified whenever there's an inactive user in your environment or whenever a user becomes over-permissioned.

> Permissions Analytics alerts can be especially useful after remediating findings in the Permissions Analytics Report, as they allow you to be proactive about acting on any future findings.
