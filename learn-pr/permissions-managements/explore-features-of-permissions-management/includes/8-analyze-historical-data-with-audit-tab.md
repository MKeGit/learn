The Audit tab in Permissions Management is where to go to query activity log information for your different cloud environments (Azure, AWS, and GCP). You can query information by Authorization System Type (cloud environment) or Authorization System (your accounts and folders). The Audit tab provides the following benefits:

- Easy to Use: Queries are constructed using a dropdown-based, no-code interface, meaning that anyone can quickly create the queries they're looking for.
- Multi-Tab Design: The design of the queries page allows you to quickly switch between and compare different queries.
- Save and Load Queries: Queries are saved and loaded from the Saved Queries dropdown.
- Exportability: Query results are easily exported to CSV format.

The Audit tab is also where you can find the activity logs for Permissions Management itself. Selecting Platform from the dropdown menu allows you to view and query all past Permissions Management activity.
