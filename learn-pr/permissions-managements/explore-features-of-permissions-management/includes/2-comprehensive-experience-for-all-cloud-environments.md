As a multicloud product, Permissions Management offers a comprehensive experience across multiple cloud environments; Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  

Each page in Permissions Management presents a dropdown menu, which allows you to easily switch between different cloud providers.

Regardless of the cloud environment you work in, the process for performing different tasks in the product (creating alerts, right-sizing roles, etc.) has the same look and feel.
