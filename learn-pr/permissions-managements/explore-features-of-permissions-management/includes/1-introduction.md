In the previous module, [Introduction to Microsoft Entra Permissions Management](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2245157), you learned that Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) is a solutions area in cybersecurity operations. CIEM addresses the management of identities and permissions in cloud environments while supporting the Zero Trust principle of least privilege. You also gained insight into Microsoft Entra Permissions Management as a Microsoft Entra solution to manage cloud entitlements with a CIEM approach. In this module, weâ€™re going to take a deeper look into the features of the product itself.
