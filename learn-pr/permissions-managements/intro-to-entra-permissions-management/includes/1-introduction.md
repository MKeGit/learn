## Introduction ##

As a security administrator, your role in maintaining insight and control over security operations and systems administration most likely finds you monitoring your workflow not only in the present, but also for past actions and future needs. You might work for a large organization that has undergone some internal changes. People have moved on to different roles or have left the company entirely, while others have recently joined. Your daily workflow might have you onboarding new individuals to various SecOp roles meant to scale with company growth. At the same time, you must keep an eye on and manage what was created in the past. When individuals in organizations change, identities and permissions need to change, otherwise permissions remain active from individuals that are no longer in approved roles. This can leave many permissions active but unused, increasing risk of excessive privileges across identities, which can leave your company vulnerable if left unchecked. 

Today's ever changing work environments require you to be nimble with security authorizations, and allow you to monitor and remedy granted access efficiently. And, adopting a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution might be just what you need. 

Let's find out.
