## When to use Microsoft Entra Permissions Management ###

Here we'll look at how Microsoft Entra Permissions Management fits in the landscape of cloud security, and within the full security offerings from Microsoft.

### Working with Privileged Access Management & Identity Governance

Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) enhances an overall set of cloud security tools by providing a correlation between entitlements across your cloud infrastructure. CIEM delivers access to monitoring, analysis of identities and permissions, and efficient detection and remediation of suspicious activity.

### Privileged Access Management ###

Privileged Access, or Identity, Management is a service in Microsoft Entra ID that allows you to manage, control, and monitor access to key resources in your organization. Privileged Access Management (PAM) complements CIEM by providing identity lifecycle management, credential management, session management and recording, and just-in-time identity access.

### Identity Governance & Administration ###

Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) allows you to balance the need for security and the need for productivity with the right processes and visibility. IGA gives you with the capabilities to ensure that the right people have access to the right resources. IGA complements CIEM by giving organizations the ability to do the following cross services and application both on-premises and in cloud environments:

- Govern the identity lifecycle
- Govern the identity access lifecycle
- Secure privileged access for administration
