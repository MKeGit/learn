## What is Permissions Management? ##

As part of the Microsoft Entra portfolio, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management, is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution that provides complete visibility into permissions that are assigned to all identities. Permissions Management gives security operation administrators insight into over-privileged workload and user identities, actions, and resources across multicloud infrastructures in Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Permissions Management leverages that insight to detect, automatically right-size, and continuously monitor permissions granted while evaluating unused and excessive permissions access.

Microsoft Entra Permissions Management is a standalone solution that is not included in existing Microsoft bundles.

### Manage identities in multicloud environments ###

The increase in the adoption of multicloud creates new access management challenges. Inconsistent methods to manage assets in multicloud platforms can cause security teams to struggle with lack of visibility and control in complex IT environments. The recent exponential growth of identities, machines, functions, and scripts operating in cloud infrastructures means that unmanaged permissions can expand your area of attack. 

According to a [*2021 State of Cloud Permissions Risks Report*](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE50V2A?culture=en-us&country=US) from Microsoft...

- More than 90 percent of identities are using less than 5 percent of the permissions that they are granted.
- More than 50 percent of permissions are high-risk and can cause catastrophic damage.

Microsoft Entra Permissions Management provides a unified platform to manage permissions for all identities, users and workflows across all major cloud infrastructures.

### A key component for zero trust frameworks ###

Your company must consider a permissions management solution that monitors and manages least-privilege access as a central piece of implementing a zero trust strategy across your cloud infrastructure. As more processes move to multicloud environments, companies face more complex scenarios to resolve:

- Organizations are increasingly adopting a multicloud strategy and are struggling with the lack of visibility and the complexity of managing access permissions.
- With the growth of identities and cloud services, the number of high-risk cloud permissions is expanding, increasing cyber attack level for organizations.
- IT security teams are under increased pressure to ensure access to their expanding cloud framework is secure and compliant.
- The inconsistency of cloud providers' native access management models make it even more complex for security and identity organizations to manage permissions and enforce least privilege access policies across their environment.

Permissions Management helps your organization tackle cloud permissions by enabling the capabilities to continuously discover, remediate and monitor the activity of every unique user and workload identity operating in the cloud. Then Permissions Management alerts security and infrastructure teams to areas of unexpected or excessive risk. With Permissions Management, your organization can:

- **Get granular cross-cloud visibility** - Get a comprehensive view of every action performed by any identity on any resource.
- **Uncover permissions risk** - Assess permissions risk by evaluating the gap between permissions granted and permissions used.
- **Enforce least privilege** - Right-size permissions based on usage and activity and enforce permissions on-demand at cloud scale.
- **Monitor and detect anomalies** - Detect anomalous permission usage and generate detailed forensic reports.

Permissions Management helps your organization tackle cloud permissions by continuously discovering, remediating and monitoring the activity of every unique user and workload identity operating across multicloud. Permissions Management alerts security and infrastructure teams to areas of unexpected or excessive risk. 

By adopting Microsoft Entra Permissions Management across multicloud environments, you're implementing a solution for managing identities, permissions and resources that establishes your organization with a core pillar of a modern zero trust security strategy.
