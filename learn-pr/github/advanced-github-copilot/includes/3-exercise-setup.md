In this exercise, we create a new repository using the GitHub template for a web API that uses the Python programming language.

## Environment setup

First you need to launch the Codespaces environment, which comes preconfigured with the GitHub Copilot extension.

1. Open the [Codespace with the preconfigured environment](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-advanced-copilot?azure-portal=true) in your browser.
1. On the **Create codespace** page, review the codespace configuration settings and then select **Create new codespace**
1. Wait for the codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.
1. The remaining exercises in this project take place in the context of this development container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with 2 core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

### Python Web API

When complete, Codespaces loads with a terminal section at the bottom. Codespaces installs all the required extensions in your container. Once the package installs are completed, Codespaces will execute the `uvicorn` command to start your web application running within your Codespace.

When the web application has successfully started, a message in the terminal shows that the server is running on port 8000 within your Codespace.

### Testing the API

Try to interact with the API by sending a request using the self-documented page. Select the POST button and then on the Try it Out button:
