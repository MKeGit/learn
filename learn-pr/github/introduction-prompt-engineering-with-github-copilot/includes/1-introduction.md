GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI, is changing the game in software development. It's not just a tool for suggesting code. GitHub Copilot can grasp the intricate details of your project through its training of data containing both natural language and billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources, including code in public GitHub repositories. This allows GitHub Copilot to provide you with more context-aware suggestions.

But to get the most out of GitHub Copilot, you need to know about prompting. This is the way you tell Copilot what you need. The quality of the code it gives back depends a lot on how clear and accurate your prompts are.

So how can you use GitHub Copilot to its full potential? This module shows you how! It guides you through the details of making effective prompts to get the best code suggestions, helping you code faster and better.
