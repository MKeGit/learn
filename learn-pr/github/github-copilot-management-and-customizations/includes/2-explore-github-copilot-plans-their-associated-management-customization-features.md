When selecting a GitHub Copilot pricing plan, you and your organization should consider several key factors:

- **Data Privacy and Security**: Different plans offer varying levels of data privacy and security measures. For instance, GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise are the only plans that provide more robust privacy     controls, including the ability to exclude specific files from GitHub Copilot's  analysis, access detailed audit logs and IP indemnity.
- **Policy Management**: The ability to manage Copilot policies at an organizational level is crucial. Business and Enterprise plans allow for comprehensive policy management, ensuring that sensitive data is handled according to the organization's privacy policies.
- **Data Collection and Retention**: Understanding how data is collected and retained is essential for compliance with data privacy regulations. Individual subscribers can choose whether their prompts and Copilot's suggestions are collected and retained by GitHub.
- **IP Indemnity and Data  Privacy**: For businesses and enterprises, IP indemnity and data privacy are critical to avoiding legal, security, and customer issues. Evaluating the need for these features can help determine the most suitable pricing plan for your business.
