To help ensure your organization remains compliant with legal requirements, we review the following topics:

- **Contractual Protections:** Understanding how contractual agreements safeguard your code and data

- Disabling matching public code to minimize potential code overlap

#### Contractual Protections: Understanding How Contractual Agreements Safeguard Your Code and Data

To help ensure your organization remains compliant with legal requirements, we review GitHub Copilot's contractual safeguards to protect your code and data, including the option to disable matching with public code.

1. **IP Indemnity**: GitHub Copilot's Business and Enterprise plans include IP indemnity, which provides legal protection against intellectual property claims related to the use of Copilot's suggestions. With IP indemnity, if any suggestion made by GitHub Copilot is challenged as infringing on third-party IP rights, GitHub assumes legal responsibility, if the “matching public code” setting is BLOCKED.
1. **Data Protection Agreements (DPA)**: GitHub offers Data Protection Agreements that outlines the measures taken to protect your data and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations. These agreements provide transparency and assurance that your data is handled securely and responsibly.
1. **GitHub Copilot Trust Center**: The GitHub Copilot Trust Center provides detailed information about how GitHub Copilot works, including security, privacy, compliance, and intellectual property safeguards. This resource helps organizations understand and feel confident using GitHub Copilot while adhering to best practices and legal requirements.

By understanding and using these contractual protections, your organization can confidently use GitHub Copilot while safeguarding your code and data.

#### Disabling Matching Public Code to Minimize Potential Code Overlap

**Disabling matching public code** helps minimize potential code overlap by identifying and filtering out code suggestions that match publicly available code. This feature is essential for maintaining the originality and security of your codebase.

How to enable duplication detection filter:

- In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Enterprise settings or Organization settings.

- In the left sidebar, click Copilot.

- Select the dropdown menu under Suggestions matching public code, then click Block to block suggestions matching public code.

- To confirm your new settings, click Save.

By enabling this feature you can significantly reduce the risk of incorporating potentially insecure or non-compliant code into your projects, thereby enhancing the overall quality and security of your codebase.
