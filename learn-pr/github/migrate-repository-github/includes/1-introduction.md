GitHub is home to millions of software projects, with more joining every day. There are so many great reasons to host your project on GitHub, but getting there from a legacy version-control system might seem daunting.

Suppose you're managing the version control for a project and want to move to GitHub. You probably have many questions, like "How do I get started?" and "How is GitHub different from what I use now?" These are valid concerns, and the good news is that you can effectively host virtually any project on GitHub.

In this module, you'll learn how to prepare and migrate a project to GitHub from a legacy version-control system.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're uploading a project that is not yet hosted in a version-control system, consider completing the [Upload your project by using GitHub best practices](/training/modules/upload-project-github) module instead.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Prepare your project for a successful migration.
- Handle any binary files currently stored in your project.
- Create important Git files like a `.gitignore`.
- Import your project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account

We recommend that you complete the [Introduction to GitHub](/training/modules/introduction-to-github) module before beginning this module.
