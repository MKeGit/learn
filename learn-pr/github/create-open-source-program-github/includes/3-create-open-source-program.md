In this guide, learn more about the world of open source and the steps you can take to get ready to launch your own open source project.

The first two sections titled **The "what" and "why" of open source** and **Should I launch my own open source project?** mostly cover content that we already discussed in the previous unit. Feel free to review these sections, but we focus on the following sections for this exercise.

- Launching your own open source project
- Naming and branding your project
- Your prelaunch checklist
