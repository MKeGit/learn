As leaders and innovators in the AI space, Microsoft and GitHub are committed to ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in ways that are safe, trustworthy, and ethically sound.

Our approach is guided by six core principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.

Our goal is to ensure that AI systems prioritize people and uphold fundamental values like fairness, reliability, and transparency.

We also encourage other organizations to adopt these standards, and we hope that by providing resources like this module, we can help developers create effective, safe, and transparent AI solutions.

We are excited for you to embark on your own AI journey and urge you to approach it with responsibility.

To recap, in this module, we covered:

- Mitigating AI risks: Identifying limitations and potential harms (bias, security, fairness, privacy, transparency) in AI-generated code.
- Responsible AI: Understanding the core principles of responsible AI and their significance with GitHub Copilot.
