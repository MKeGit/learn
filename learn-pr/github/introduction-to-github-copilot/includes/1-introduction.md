GitHub Copilot is the world's first at-scale AI developer tool that can help you write code faster with less work. GitHub Copilot draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly.

Research finds that GitHub Copilot helps developers code faster, focus on solving bigger problems, stay in the flow longer, and feel more fulfilled with their work.

OpenAI created GitHub Copilot's generative pretrained language model, powered by OpenAI Codex. An extension is available for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and the JetBrains suite of integrated development environments (IDEs).
