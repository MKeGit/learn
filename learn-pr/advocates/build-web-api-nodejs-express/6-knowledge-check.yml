quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "What steps do you need to construct a web application with Express?"
      choices:
        - content: "Instantiate an app, Configure routes, Set up middleware, Set up error handlers, Listen to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. All of these steps are useful, but they're not all are required. You only need to instantiate an app and listen to the server to construct a web application with Express."
        - content: "Instantiate an app, Listen to the server"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. These steps are all you need to get an app up and running. We do strongly recommend that you configure some routes."
        - content: "Instantiate an app, Configure routes, Listen to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You don't actually need to configure routes, although we highly recommend that step."
        - content: "Instantiate an app, Configure routes, Set up middleware, Listen to the server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You don't have to configure routes or set up middleware, although we highly recommend those steps."
    - content: "What's the preferred way to send a JSON response from an Express app?"
      choices:
        - content: "Call the `json()` helper method on the response object, `res.json({ content: '' })`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. There are many ways to send a response as JSON, but this way is the most common and simplest to use."
        - content: "Call `res.send({ content: '' })`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This call sends the response as text."
        - content: "Call `res.send(JSON.stringify({ content: '' }))`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. This call does technically send the response as JSON, but it's simpler and easier to use the `res.json()` helper method."
        - content: "Use any of these ways: `res.type('json')`, `res.type('application/json')`, `res.contentType('application/json')`, `res.format({ 'application/json': function() { res.send({}) } })`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. These method calls are valid ways of sending something as JSON, but they're considered more advanced. The `res.json()` helper method is by far the easiest way."
    - content: "How would you set up Express to handle a post request with JSON data?"
      choices:
        - content: "Register a route by using the `post` method as in `app.post(<route>, () =>{})`, Read from the `req.body` object"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You need to configure a body parsing middleware or the posted data won't be available on the `req.body` object."
        - content: "Configure body parsing middleware, Register a route by using the `post` method as in `app.post(<route>, () =>{})`, Read from the `req.data` object"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The posted data is available on the `req.body` object, not the `req.data` object."
        - content: "Call `app.use(bodyParser.json())` at the top, Register a route by using the `post` method as in `app.post(<route>, () =>{})`, Read from the `req.body` object"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. This call configures the `bodyParser` to interpret the incoming data as JSON."
        - content: "Call `app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }))` at the top, Register a route by using the `post` method as in `app.post(<route>, () =>{})`, Read from the `req.body` object"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The configuration at the top is wrong. It instructs Express to receive posted data from a form that's URL encoded. The correct configuration is `app.use(bodyParser.json())`."
