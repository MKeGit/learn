quiz:
    questions:
    - content: "How do you bind your function to Twilio to send SMS messages?"
      choices:
      - content: "By returning the SMS messages as the return value of the Function"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Bindings for Azure Functions are defined using parameters to the function."
      - content: "A function parameter"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. SMS messages are added to a collection passed to the function as a parameter decorated with the `[TwilioSms]` attribute. The Function's runtime will send these messages to Twilio once the function returns."
      - content: "Direct call to the Twilio API"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Sending SMS messages via Twilio requires an output binding that's configured with your account subscription ID (SID) and auth token."

    - content: "Where do you define your Twilio account SID and auth token when running your function locally?"
      choices:
      - content: "In the `local.settings.json` file"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The `local.settings.json` file is used to store local settings that are only used when running locally, not when published to Azure. Be careful to not check this into source code control if it contains private keys and your repo is public."
      - content: "In the `[TwilioSms]` attribute"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The `[TwilioSms]` attribute includes the SID and auth token parameters, not the variables."
      - content: "Application settings published to Azure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The Application Settings dialog displays application settings with both a local and remote value."
