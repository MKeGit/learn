This module provides an overview of monitoring Azure Machine Learning. You learned that Azure Machine Learning is composed by different resources in Azure, such as Compute and Workspace, and how to check metrics for these resources. You also learned how to enable Diagnostic Settings for an Azure Machine Learning workspace, allowing you to query logs from the Azure Machine Learning resources. Finally, you learned why it's important to monitor the Machine Learning models to avoid them becoming obsolete and stale.
