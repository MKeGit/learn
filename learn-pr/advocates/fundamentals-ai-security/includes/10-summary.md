You learned about the distinct challenges it presents compared to traditional cybersecurity measures and you learned about some of the mitigations that can be implemented to prevent these exploits. We've looked at You have learned the significance of Responsible AI and the three layers of AI architecture and what security issues can occur at each layer.
