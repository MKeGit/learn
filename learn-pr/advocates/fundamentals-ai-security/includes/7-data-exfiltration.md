Data exfiltration, also known as data theft, is the unauthorized transfer of information from computers or devices. The rise of AI technologies has made this threat more significant, as AI can both enhance defenses and enable more sophisticated attacks. Two types of exfiltration are exfiltration of the AI model and exfiltration of training dat.

**Data Exfiltration of the AI Model**: This refers to the unauthorized siphoning of information from an AI model. It involves stealing the model's architecture, weights, or other proprietary components. Attackers can exploit this to replicate or misuse the model for their purposes, potentially compromising its integrity and intellectual property.

**Exfiltration of Training Data**: This occurs when training data used to build an AI model is illicitly transferred or leaked. It involves unauthorized access to sensitive datasets, which can lead to privacy breaches, bias amplification, or even adversarial attacks. Protecting training data is crucial to prevent such exfiltration.

AI plays a pivotal role in both preventing and enabling data exfiltration. While AI can help detect and mitigate data breaches, it also provides attackers with advanced tools to steal sensitive information. This dual influence of AI creates a complex challenge for organizations aiming to protect their valuable data.

Data exfiltration can be mitigated by using good security hygiene: principle of these privilege, patching systems and keeping them up to date, labelling and classifying data and adopting a zero trust architecture.
