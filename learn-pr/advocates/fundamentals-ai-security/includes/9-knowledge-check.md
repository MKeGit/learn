What is one of the main challenges of securing AI systems?

1. Nondeterministic nature of generative AI systems [As AI systems are nondeterministic, this means that you do not always get the same output with the same input. Security controls have traditionally been based on the same input equals the same output every time, so this creates challenges when looking to apply security controls to AI systems.]
1. AI is fundamentally insecure [AI is not fundamentally insecure, although securing AI systems is a rapidly developing field and new methods to secure it are being developed all the time.]
1. AI is too new to secure [Whilst AI is a new technology and methods for securing it are developing rapidly, it is not impossible to apply security controls to AI.]

Which kind of jailbreak attack involves sending an AI model multiple prompts to incrementally break guardrails to enact a jailbreak attack?

1. Crescendo [Crescendo acts over several turns, gradually shifting the conversation to a particular end to enact a jailbreak.]
1. Bar break [This is not a real attack.]
1. Diminuendo [This is not a real attack.]
1. Mass breakout [This is not a real attack.]

Which of the following is NOT an AI architecture layer?

1. AI Application Security [AI application security is the AI architecture layer that deals with how an application accesses the AI capabilities and provides the service or interface that will be consumed by the user. This is the "middle" layer in AI architecture.]

2. AI Usage Security [AI Usage Security is the AI architecture layer that deals with how AI capabilities are ultimately used and consumed, this is the layer that is "top" of the stack and closest to human users.]

3. AI Platform Security [AI platform security is the AI architecture layer that deals with providing AI capabilities to applications. This is the "bottom" layer of the stack.]

4. AI Infrastructure Security [AI infrastructure security is not an AI architecture layer, infrastructure for AI sits at the AI platform layer but there is more than just infrastructure at this layer.]
