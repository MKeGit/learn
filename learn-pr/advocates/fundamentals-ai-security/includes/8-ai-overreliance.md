AI overreliance describes people accepting the output of AI systems as correct without critical analysis. For example, a company might choose to rely upon the response of an AI to make critical business decisions instead of performing their own process to make the decision. AI overreliance can lead to errors and issues, especially in critical contexts like medical diagnosis or legal decisions. Researchers are exploring ways to mitigate overreliance. Methods of mitigating overreliance include outputting simpler AI explanations and disclaimers and increasing the stakes for correct answers. 

Research finds that when an AI provides an explanation of its reasoning, this doesn't significantly reduce overreliance compared to only providing predictions. AI overreliance is partially a human problem as people are more likely to accept explanations that sound plausible. Many people also assume that explanations derived by an AI aren't subject to bias.

User experience designers (UX Designers) play a crucial role in mitigating AI overreliance. Here are some strategies they can employ:

- **Explanations**: Create interfaces that provide clear explanations for AI recommendations. When users understand the reasoning behind suggestions, they are less likely to blindly rely on them.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to customize AI behavior. By giving them control over settings and preferences, you empower them to make informed decisions.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Enable users to provide feedback on AI performance. This loop helps improve trust and ensures users remain vigilant.
