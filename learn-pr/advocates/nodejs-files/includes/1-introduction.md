Node.js has powerful built-in mechanisms for working with the file system.

Assume for a moment that you work for a company called *Tailwind Traders*. Tailwind Traders is the second-largest online retailer in the world. It deals with mountains of data and files. The company has hired you to help it manage its data and files by using Node.js.

In this module, you write a program that searches through folders for sales files. When those files are found, you use Node.js to read and parse the sales-total data inside. Finally, you summarize those sales totals into one grand total and write that value to a new file.
