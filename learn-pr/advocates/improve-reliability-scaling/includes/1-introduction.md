The Dickerson hierarchy of reliability has served as the roadmap for this learning path. Over the course of the previous five modules, we have come up through the levels from the foundational step of monitoring to incident response, post-incident review, and deployment.

In this final module, you complete your journey at the capacity and scale level. You learn how to handle the threat to reliability that comes with growth, ensuring that your solutions can scale.

When you have completed this module, you'll:

- Learn about scalability and the scalability and reliability relationship.
- Understand the role of capacity planning in preparing for growth.
- Learn basic concepts and fundamental terms related to scaling.
- Eliminate single points of failure.
- Understand the different kinds of growth and how to respond to them.
- Be able to measure capacity in the cloud.
- Use Azure tools to catch issues with service limits and quotas before they emerge.
- Understand important steps to take before beginning work on scaling.
- List techniques for making an application more scalable. Including, decoupling, queues, in-memory caching, and database sharding.
- Learn about the Azure tools that make it possible to take your application or service global.
