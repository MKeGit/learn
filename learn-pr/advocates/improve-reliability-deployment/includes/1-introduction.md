In this learning path, we've referenced the Dickerson hierarchy of reliability as a map for reliability work. It gives us a way to understand on what things we need to work and in what order. The first three levels of monitoring, incident response, and learning from failure via the post-incident review have set us up to talk about the next level of the hierarchy, the test/release/deployment practices. 

For example, one of the useful outcomes of a post-incident review can be an understanding of work we need to do to prevent the incident from reoccurring. One way we can do this is to make sure that certain problematic code or configuration never makes it to production. That's where this module's focus on deployment comes into play. The goal will be to find out if it's possible to prevent certain kinds of incidents before they happen using modern DevOps practices that result in more reliable systems.

When you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Define deployment and recognize the difference between traditional and modern deployment practices.
- Describe the continuous delivery/deployment model.
- List goals you can achieve by using DevOps practices to deploy software.
- Recognize three deployment strategies.
- Identify tools you can use for test automation.
- Explain environment traceability.
