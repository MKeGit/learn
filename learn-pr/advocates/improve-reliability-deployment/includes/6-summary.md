One important step towards improving your reliability is to prevent incidents whenever possible. When you do have incidents, tracking down the problem quickly is also important. The test/release or deployment process can have a strong impact on both of these goals.

In this module, you:

- Learned about what software deployment is and different kinds of deployments we might employ.
- Discussed the significant benefits of switching from an "epic deployment" model to a "continuous deployment" model.
- Explored the components of continuous deployment.
- Looked deeper into pipelines and how they're implemented in Azure Pipelines.
- Learned a number of different strategies for deployment to production that can help avoid incidents.
- Examined some important best practices that can minimize the risk when rolling out new software or a new version of existing software.
