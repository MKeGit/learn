  questions:
    - content: What is the primary purpose of using Apache Maven in Java web application development?
      choices:
        - content: To provide a web server for hosting the application.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Maven is a build automation tool, not a web server.
        - content: To design the user interface of the web application.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Maven focuses on project management and build automation, not UI design.
        - content: To manage project dependencies and automate the build process.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! Maven helps manage dependencies and automates the build and deployment processes, streamlining development.

    - content: How does deploying a Java web application to Microsoft Azure App Service benefit developers?
      choices:
        - content: It automatically converts Java code to a faster language.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Azure App Service does not convert code. It hosts applications as they are.
        - content: It eliminates the need for a build automation tool like Maven.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Build automation tools are still needed for compiling and packaging the application before deployment.
        - content: It provides a scalable, managed hosting environment without the need to manage infrastructure.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! Azure App Service allows developers to deploy applications easily, handling scaling and infrastructure management.

    - content: What is the primary role of a servlet in a Java web application?
      choices:
        - content: To manage database connections and queries.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Servlets can interact with databases, but their main role is handling web requests and generating dynamic content.
        - content: To handle client requests and generate dynamic content on the server side.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! The main role of a servlet is to handle client requests and generate server-side responses.
        - content: To define the application's user interface.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Servlets work on the server side and do not manage the user interface, which is handled by client-side components.

    - content: Why is Apache Tomcat used in Java web application development?
      choices:
        - content: It serves as a servlet container that implements Java Servlet and JSP specifications.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! Tomcat provides an environment to run Java servlets and JSPs, which is essential for Java web applications.
        - content: It is a frontend framework for designing responsive web interfaces.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Tomcat is a server-side technology and does not deal with frontend design.
        - content: It is a database system used for storing application data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Tomcat is a web server and servlet container, not a database system.
