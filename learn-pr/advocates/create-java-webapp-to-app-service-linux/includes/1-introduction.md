Web applications play an essential role in managing tasks like accounting, inventory tracking, and providing online portals for users to access and update information. In these applications, users typically submit inputs, which the system processes to search, display, and update relevant data.

In this module, you’ll tackle the challenge of deploying a Java-based web application. You’ll learn how to create and deploy a simple Tomcat web application using Maven, first on your local machine and then on Azure App Service, where it can be accessed remotely. By the end of this module, you’ll have the skills to deploy a Tomcat Java web application, equipping you with a foundational approach to web app deployment on cloud services.
