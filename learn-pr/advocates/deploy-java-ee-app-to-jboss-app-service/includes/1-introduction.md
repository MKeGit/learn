Many enterprises, such as purchase management, manufacturing, and customer relationship management use Jakarta EE applications.

Take the example of a freight-delivery service with the following capabilities:

- Your service receives a package, captures the shipping address information, and registers the delivery address.
- Your service queries and updates data from a relational database.

In a similar way, in this module, you create a database on Azure Database for MySQL. You then create and deploy a Jakarta EE application to JBoss EAP on Azure App Service. Finally, you learn how to manage your application's life cycle.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to complete the following tasks:

- Create and manage an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance.
- Deploy a Jakarta EE app to JBoss EAP on Azure App Service.
- Create a data source and bind your Jakarta EE app to MySQL.
- Access and manage the Jakarta EE app on JBoss.
