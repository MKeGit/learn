The steps include define your use case, map, measure, mitigate, and operate. Governance is a concept that occurs during all phases of the lifecycle." lightbox="../media/generative-ai-lifecycle.png":::

While each step in the process is essential to building trustworthy generative AI solutions, the measurement phase is critical to iterative development and getting apps into production. Azure AI provides a robust toolkit for evaluating generative AI in a repeatable, transparent way. This module introduces the key concepts of measuring the frequency and severity of various risks in AI systems.
