Accurately interpreting evaluation results isn't only valuable; it's essential. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated and are deployed in critical domains such as healthcare and, finance, the stakes for misinterpretation grow exponentially. Interpreting evaluation results involves more than just reading numbers; it requires understanding the metrics, the AI's operating context, and the real-world impacts of its performance. Misinterpreting these results can lead to overconfidence in flawed systems, overlooking critical weaknesses, or missing opportunities for crucial improvements.

## Contextualizing evaluation results

When interpreting evaluation results for generative AI output, it's crucial to consider the broader context in which the AI system operates. This context helps provide a more nuanced and meaningful interpretation of the results.

### Consider the specific use case and objectives

Every AI application has unique goals and requirements. When analyzing evaluation results, always refer to the original objectives of the AI system. For instance, an AI designed for creative writing might prioritize originality and engagement over factual accuracy, while an AI for medical diagnosis would have opposite priorities.

### Analyze trends over multiple evaluations

Single evaluations can be misleading due to various factors such as data anomalies or testing conditions. For example, if a customer support AI system is only evaluated during business hours (for example, 9 AM to 5 PM), it might perform exceptionally well because the types of customer inquiries during this time might be more routine or predictable. However, by conducting evaluations at various times (for example, business hours, evenings, weekends, holidays), you might uncover differences in the AI's ability to handle varying customer moods or urgency levels that might change throughout the day or week.

## Interpreting different types of results

Evaluation results often come in various forms, each offering unique insights into the AI's performance. Understanding how to interpret these different types of results is key to a comprehensive evaluation.

### Balancing quantitative and qualitative insights

The most robust interpretations come from combining quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments. This balanced approach provides a more complete picture of the AI's performance, capturing both measurable outcomes and subjective qualities that are often crucial in real-world applications.

### Qualitative feedback and its implications

Human evaluations and open-ended feedback offer insights that numeric scores can't capture, such as the naturalness of generated text or the appropriateness of responses in context. This feedback can highlight subtle issues or unexpected strengths in the AI system’s output. For example, consider a generative AI app designed to function as a customer service chatbot for an airline. A human reviewer might note that while the chatbot's responses are grammatically correct, they often sound robotic and lack the warmth expected in customer service interactions.

Example interaction:

**Customer**: "I'm really worried about missing my connecting flight due to a delay."

**Chatbot**: "Your concern about missing your connecting flight due to a delay is noted. In the event of a missed connection caused by a delay in our service, you'll be re-booked on the next available flight at no additional cost."

While factually correct and helpful, the response lacks empathy and a natural conversational tone. The response could lead to customer dissatisfaction despite the accurate information provided.

### Numeric scores and their significance

Quantitative metrics like accuracy scores or BLEU scores provide concrete, comparable data points. However, it's important to understand what each score represents and its limitations. For example, a high accuracy score might mask poor performance on rare but critical cases.

Consider a generative AI app designed for translating medical texts from English to Spanish. When tested on a large dataset of response and ground truth data, the model output achieves a high overall BLEU score of 0.85 (on a scale from 0 to 1, where 1 is perfect). This score suggests that, on average, the AI-generated translations closely match reference translations created by human experts. It indicates that the model generally produces fluent and accurate translations for most of the medical text.

What’s not blatantly obvious is that the model might choose common translations that are incorrect in specific contexts, yet still achieve a high BLEU score. For instance, medical terms often require context-specific translations. AI might translate the phrase "The operation revealed a frozen shoulder"  to "La operación reveló un hombro congelado". However, in the medical context, the correct translation would be "La operación reveló una capsulitis adhesive". "Frozen shoulder" is a medical term that shouldn't be translated literally, but the literal translation might still score well in a BLEU evaluation.
