In this module you learned the core concepts of Playwright for automated end to end testing and then you:

* Installed Playwright and ran the example tests
* Explored the HTML report
* Modified the test directory to see the demo todo tests being ran
* Added a project in the config file to see tests being ran on an emulated mobile device
* Configured Playwright to run tests with screenshots and traces
* Explored the trace viewer
* Took a detailed view of the tests to understand how tests are written using fixtures, locators and assertions
* Installed the VS Code extension and learned how to run our tests, debug our tests and generate our tests all from VS Code
* Created a test using Playwrights test generator, Codegen
* Manually created a test spec and used a describe block, beforeEach hook, a baseURL and created a reusable locator.
