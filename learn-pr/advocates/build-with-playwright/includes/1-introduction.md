Thanks to CI/CD pipelines, modern web apps are deployed more frequently, often being pushed to production multiple times daily. Web apps are becoming more complex - with more dynamic content, more elements per page, and more complex user interactions. Web apps are accessed by more users, on a wider range of devices, and over more diverse networks.

Delivering a reliable and consistent user experience in this environment is challenging. Testing becomes critical to ensure that the app is working as expected, and that new changes don't break existing functionality. Traditional Quality Assurance approaches that are relied on manual testers wouldn't scale due to the demands of these modern apps. We need automated testing approaches that can perform repetitive, time-consuming tests reliably and consistently.

Test Automation is the process of using software tools and processes to execute testing strategies with minimal manual involvement and automated repeatable workflows. Test Automation frameworks provide tools, libraries, and rules for developers to execute automated testing plans. Popular options include Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will learn:

* How to use Playwright to test a sample web application. 
* How to run tests, view test reports, and understand the structure of a Playwright project.
* How to use Visual Studio Code to run tests, debug tests, and record new tests.
* How to create a new test suite, and how to refine your tests. 

## Prerequisites

To get started with Playwright,

* Visual Studio Code installed
* Latest version of node
* Latest version of npm
