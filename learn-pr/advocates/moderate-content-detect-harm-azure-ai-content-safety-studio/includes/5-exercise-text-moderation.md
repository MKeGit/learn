Contoso Camping Store gives customers the ability to speak with an AI-powered customer support agent and post product reviews. You can apply an AI model to detect whether the text input from customers is harmful. You can then use the detection results to implement the necessary precautions.

## Safe content

First, test some positive customer feedback:

1. On the **Content Safety** page, select **Moderate text content**.
1. In the **Test** box, enter the following content:

   *I recently used the PowerBurner Camping Stove on my camping trip, and I must say, it was fantastic! It was easy to use, and the heat control was impressive. Great product!*

1. Set all **Threshold level** values to **Medium**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/text-moderation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the area for selecting categories and threshold levels for text moderation."  lightbox="../media/text-moderation.png":::
1. Select **Run test**.

The content is **Allowed**, and the severity level is **Safe** across all categories. You probably expected this result, given the positive and unharmful sentiment of the customer's feedback.

The severity level for all categories is Safe. The threshold setting for all categories is Medium. And the judgment for all categories is Allowed."  lightbox="../media/text-moderation-allow-results.png":::

## Harmful content

But what happens if you test a harmful statement? Try a test with negative customer feedback. Although it's OK for customers to dislike a product, you don't want to condone any name calling or degrading statements.

1. In the **Test** box, enter the following content:

   *I recently bought a tent, and I have to say, I'm really disappointed. The tent poles seem flimsy, and the zippers are constantly getting stuck. It's not what I expected from a high-end tent. You all suck and are a sorry excuse for a brand.*

1. Set all **Threshold level** values to **Medium**.
1. Select **Run test**.

   Although the content is **Allowed**, the **Severity level** value for **Hate** is **Low**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/text-moderation-low-hate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the text moderation results. The content is allowed, but the severity level for the Hate category is Low. The severity level is Safe across all other categories."  lightbox="../media/text-moderation-low-hate.png":::

   To guide the model to block such content, you need to adjust the threshold level for **Hate**. A lower threshold level would block any content that has a low, medium, or high severity.

1. Set the **Threshold level** value for **Hate** to **Low**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/text-moderation-low-threshold-hate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the settings for configuring filters for text moderation. The threshold for the Hate category set to Low."  lightbox="../media/text-moderation-low-threshold-hate.png":::
1. Select **Run test**.

The content is now **Blocked**. The filter in the **Hate** category rejected it.

:::image type="content" source="../media/text-moderation-blocked-content.png" alt-text="Screenshot of text moderation results. The content is blocked. The severity level for the Hate category is Low. The threshold for the Hate category is Low. The judgment for the Hate category is Blocked."  lightbox="../media/text-moderation-blocked-content.png":::

## Violent content with misspellings

You can't expect all text content from customers to be free of spelling errors. Fortunately, the tool for moderating text can detect harmful content that has spelling errors. Test this capability on customer feedback about an incident with a racoon:

1. In the **Test** box, enter the following content:

   *I recently purchased a campin cooker, but we had an acident. A racon got inside, was shocked, and dyed. Its blod is all over the interior. How do I clean the cooker?*

1. Set all **Threshold level** values to **Medium**.
1. Select **Run test**.

The content is **Blocked**, and the severity level for **Violence** is **Medium**.

Consider a scenario where the customer is asking this question in a conversation with the AI-powered customer support agent. The customer hopes to receive guidance on how to clean the cooker. There might be no ill intent in submitting this question, so it might be a better choice not to block such content.

As the developer, consider various scenarios where such content might be OK before you decide to adjust the filter and block similar content.

## Run a bulk test

So far, you tested singular, isolated text content. However, you can test a bulk dataset of text content all at once and receive metrics based on the model's performance.

You have a bulk dataset of statements from both customers and support agents. The dataset also includes fabricated harmful statements to test the model's ability to detect harmful content. Each record in the dataset includes a label to indicate whether the content is harmful.

Do another test round, but this time with the dataset:

1. Switch to the **Run a bulk test** tab.
1. In the **Select a sample or upload your own** section, select **Browse for a file** and upload the **bulk-text-moderation-data.csv** file.
1. In the **Dataset preview** section, browse through the records and their corresponding labels. A label of **0** indicates that the content is acceptable (not harmful). A label of **1** indicates that the content is unacceptable (harmful).

    :::image type="content" source="../media/bulk-text-moderation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dataset preview for bulk text moderation. A list of records and their corresponding labels is on the left. The section to configure filters is on the right."  lightbox="../media/bulk-text-moderation.png":::

1. Set all **Threshold level** values to **Medium**.
1. Select **Run test**.

For bulk tests, you get a different assortment of test results. First, you get the proportion of **Allowed** versus **Blocked** content. You also get the following metrics:

- The **Precision** metric reveals how much of the content that the model identified as harmful is actually harmful. It's a measurement of how accurate the model is. The maximum value is **1**.

- The **Recall** metric reveals how much of the actual harmful content the model correctly identified. It's a measurement of the model's ability to identify actual harmful content. The maximum value is **1**.

- The **F1 score** metric is a function of **Precision** and **Recall**. You need this metric when you seek a balance between **Precision** and **Recall**. The maximum value is **1**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/bulk-text-moderation-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of results for bulk text moderation."  lightbox="../media/bulk-text-moderation-results.png":::

You can also view each record and the severity level across each enabled category. The **Judgment** column consists of the following values:

- **Allowed**
- **Blocked**
- **Allowed with warning**
- **Blocked with warning**

The warnings are an indication that the general judgment from the model is different from the corresponding record label. To resolve such differences, you can adjust the **Threshold level** values in the **Configure filters** section to fine-tune the model.

The final result from a bulk test is the distribution across categories. This result considers the number of records that the service judged to be **Safe** compared to the records for the corresponding category, which were either **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/bulk-text-moderation-distribution-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the results for severity distributed by category."  lightbox="../media/bulk-text-moderation-distribution-results.png":::

Based on the results, is there room for improvement? If so, adjust the **Threshold** levels until the **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 score** metrics are closer to **1**.
