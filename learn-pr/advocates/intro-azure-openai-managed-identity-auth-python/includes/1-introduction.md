Good security practices require that we control access to applications that we develop and developing an application in Azure OpenAI is no different. In this module you'll learn about configuring authentication to Azure OpenAI using Python, the available roles in Azure OpenAI and the benefits of using managed identity over API keys.

Learning objectives:

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the different RBAC roles for use in Azure OpenAI and understand how to configure role assignments
- Understand the differences between using API keys and managed identities within Azure OpenAI
- Understand how to configure keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for local development for Python
- Understand how to configure keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for Azure-hosted environments for Python
