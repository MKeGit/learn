Monitoring is the first and foundational level of Dickerson's Hierarchy of Reliability discussed in the intro to this learning path. It provides you with the information you need to have concrete conversations about reliability based on objective data.

When you have completed this module, you will:

- Start to engage with operational awareness, the precursor to effective monitoring.
- Expand your understanding of reliability and some of the aspects you might want to consider measuring.
- Change the way you frame your thinking around reliability using principles from site reliability engineering.
- Explore Azure Monitor, a key platform for monitoring reliability on Azure.
- Learn the basics of Log Analytics and its query language.
- Define and measure reliability with service level indicators (SLIs) and service level objectives (SLOs).
- Be able to use Log Analytics to implement a basic SLI and SLO on Azure.
- Be able to craft actionable alerts to support a sustainable operations practice.
