  questions:
    - content: "What is Node.js?"
      choices:
        - content: "A Java framework"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js isn't a framework or a Java runtime."
        - content: "A JavaScript framework"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js isn't a framework but is sometimes incorrectly described as one."
        - content: "A JavaScript runtime"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Node.js is a runtime that runs JavaScript applications."
        - content: "A JavaScript server"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js isn't a server but can be used to implement one."
    - content: "How does Node.js handle concurrent tasks?"
      choices:
        - content: "Node.js can't handle concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js was designed to handle concurrent operations."
        - content: "Node.js uses multiple threads for concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js doesn't use multiple threads."
        - content: "Node.js uses a single event loop for concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Node.js uses a single thread and an event loop to handle concurrent, non-blocking I/O tasks."
        - content: "Node.js uses multiple event loops for concurrent tasks."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js uses only a single event loop."
    - content: "For which of these scenarios would a Node.js app be a good fit?"
      choices:
        - content: "The app requires a non-blocking, event-driven server."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. Node.js works well for implementing back-end API services and real-time applications."
        - content: "The app needs a Java runtime."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js apps are written in JavaScript, not Java."
        - content: "You need to build a mobile app."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. You can build mobile apps by using many languages, including JavaScript. Node.js is a runtime, not a language."
        - content: "The app requires CPU-intensive computations."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Node.js works well for I/O but isn't well optimized for CPU-intensive computations."
