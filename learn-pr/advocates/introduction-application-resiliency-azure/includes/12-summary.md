In this module you learned about the importance of resiliency when designing applications on Azure. You also learned about the process of designing and deploying highly resilient applications. Azure continuously is making improvements to platform reliability by investing in the foundation aspects. Azure also offers inbuilt services that can be leveraged to design and deploy resilient applications. Customers should understand the shared responsibility model when deploying applications in the cloud and ensure they design the application components to be resilient to failures.
