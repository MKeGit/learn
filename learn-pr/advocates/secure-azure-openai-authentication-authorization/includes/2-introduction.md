Good security practices require that we control access to applications that we develop and developing an application in Azure OpenAI is no different. In this module you'll learn about configuring authentication to Azure OpenAI, the different aspects to consider, and examples of how to build code to achieve this.

Learning objectives:

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the different methods of authenticating to Azure OpenAI, including API keys and managed identities.
- Understand the differences between using API keys and managed identities within Azure OpenAI, including the distinction between system-assigned and user-assigned identities.
- Understand the different role-based access control (RBAC) roles available to configure in OpenAI.
- Understand why managed identities are more secure than API keys
