Having completed this module, you now have an understanding of how to control access to applications developed in Azure OpenAI. You have learned to configure authentication using Java, explored the various RBAC roles available in Azure OpenAI, and understood the benefits of using managed identities over API keys. You can describe the different RBAC roles, configure role assignments, and set up keyless authentication for Azure-hosted environments using Java. This knowledge equips you to implement robust security practices in your Azure OpenAI applications.
