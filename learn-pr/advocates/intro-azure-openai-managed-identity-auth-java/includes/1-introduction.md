Good security practices require that we control access to applications that we develop and developing an application in Azure OpenAI is no different. In this module, you'll learn about configuring authentication to Azure OpenAI using Java, the different aspects to consider, and examples of how to build code to achieve this.

Learning objectives:

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Understand why managed identities are more secure than API keys
- Understand how to configure keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for local development in Java
- Understand how to configure keyless authentication to Azure OpenAI for Java
