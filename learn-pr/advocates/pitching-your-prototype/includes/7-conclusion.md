We created the Fabrikam pitch deck using the following process:

- Expanded on our "elevator pitch" to include the story, the problem, our solution, and why we're the right people to solve it.
- Identified our audience and tailored our message to their interests.
- Explained how Fabrikam's business works and how we make money.
- Demonstrated our prototype, showing our audience the key features.
- Made the "ask" of our audience for what we need to grow our business.

We now have a compelling pitch for our product prototype. We convinced the audience of our potential, the value of our app, and got the investment we need to grow our business.
