After you articulate your extended elevator pitch and identify your audience's concerns, you can share the operational details of your business.

The most brilliant, beautiful, or useful product is only as good as the go-to-market strategy you adopt. If no one uses your product, then you failed. It's important to demonstrate to your audience a go-to-market strategy, which is the story of how you acquire users and generally how you make money.

## Explain how you get customers

Explain your go-to-market plan, starting with the size of the market opportunity.

Explain how you acquire customers. Your explanation should include the channels you plan to use, such as advertising, influencer outreach, content, or the like. If there are unique or specific marketing techniques or channels that make your go-to-market stand out, now is the time to highlight them.

Along with any techniques planned, you should indicate your targets for customer acquisition and the time frame over which you intend to acquire them.

## Explain your revenue model

The other side of your go-to-market plan is how you plan to make money, such as your business model or monetization strategy. Some investors are open to a strategy of building a product and growing its customer base and monetizing later. But even those investors are interested in your future plans to make money.

For a pitch, you generally don't need to go deep into numbers, although you should have that data available because you're going to be asked if the investment proceeds. Identify the specific revenue model, such as subscriptions or per unit, and your rough expectations on revenue.
