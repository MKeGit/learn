JavaScript interoperability enables you to write Blazor code that works with existing JavaScript libraries, or invoke .NET code from JavaScript.

A Blazor component has a well-defined lifecycle. You can hook into the events that are triggered when a component is created, initialized, and rendered, and then add custom logic by overriding the lifecycle methods the `ComponentBase` class provides.

You can create Blazor template components that you reuse across multiple applications and adapt for different scenarios.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Call JavaScript functions from .NET code and call .NET code from JavaScript in Blazor apps.
- Handle events in the Blazor component lifecycle.
- Change component display by passing it a template.
