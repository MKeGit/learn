As your development team makes progress on functionality in a .NET Aspire solution, you need to deploy it to test and staging environments and eventually into production. Once deployed, Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) pipelines enable teams to role out fixes and new functionality at regular intervals.

Imagine you work at an outdoor equipment retailer. Your new public-facing eShop, which uses .NET Aspire, is approaching the version 1 milestone. You want to deploy it firstly to a test environment and later to a production environment that can respond rapidly to changes in demand.

In this module, you'll learn how to deploy a .NET Aspire solution to two services in Azure: Azure Container Apps (ACA) and Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Deploy a .NET Aspire solution, including microservices and integrations, to Azure Container Apps.
- Deploy a .NET Aspire solution to a Kubernetes cluster, such as Azure Kubernetes Service.
