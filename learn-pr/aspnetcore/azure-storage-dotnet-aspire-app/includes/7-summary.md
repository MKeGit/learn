Since microservices are frequently deployed to the cloud for production, Azure is a good fit to provide storage services for files, tables, and message queues. Azure Storage accounts can provide this functionality and .NET Aspire includes integrations that make it easy to connect to them and start storing and retrieving information. In this module, you've learned how to add the .NET Aspire Azure Storage integrations to your cloud-native application and written code that interacts with Azure Storage accounts.

Now that you've completed this module, you can:

- Use the .NET Aspire Azure Blob Storage integration to store files.
- Use the .NET Aspire Azure Storage Queues integration to add messages to a queue.
- Use the .NET Aspire Azure Table Storage integration to add rows to a table.
