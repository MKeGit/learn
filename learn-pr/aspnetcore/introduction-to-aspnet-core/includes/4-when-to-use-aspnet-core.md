ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications. Whether ASP.NET Core is the right web development framework for you depends on many factors.

## When to use ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core for web development is ideal when your web app has any of these requirements:

- **Rich user interfaces**: You want to build interactive and dynamic web applications. With support for Blazor and popular front-end JavaScript frameworks, ASP.NET Core allows you to create rich user interfaces.
- **API development**: You need to develop robust API services. ASP.NET Core supports both RESTful APIs and gRPC, providing flexibility for different communication needs.
- **Microservices architecture**: You're building a microservices-based architecture. ASP.NET Core’s lightweight and modular design is well-suited for microservices.
- **High performance**: Your application demands high performance and scalability. ASP.NET Core is designed to handle high traffic and large-scale applications efficiently.
- **Modern development practices**: You prefer modern development practices such as dependency injection, asynchronous programming, and modular architecture. ASP.NET Core supports these practices out of the box.
- **Cross-platform requirements**: You need to develop applications that run on Windows, macOS, Linux and Docker. ASP.NET Core’s cross-platform capabilities make it an excellent choice for diverse environments.
- **Cloud integration**: You plan to deploy your applications to the cloud. ASP.NET Core integrates seamlessly with Azure and other cloud platforms, simplifying deployment and management.
- **Security and compliance**: You require strong security features and compliance with industry standards. ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for HTTPS, data protection, and other security best practices.

## When ASP.NET Core might not be a good fit

ASP.NET Core might not be a good fit for your web development needs when your web app has any of these requirements:

- **Minimal requirements**: Your application is a simple static page site.
- **Specific language preferences**: Your team prefers working with languages other than C#. While ASP.NET Core supports multiple languages, it's primarily designed for C# development.
