ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled, Internet-connected apps. Whether ASP.NET Core is the right web development framework for you depends on many factors.

## When to use ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core for web development is ideal when your web app has any of these requirements:

- High performance: Your application demands high performance and scalability. ASP.NET Core is designed to handle high traffic and large-scale applications efficiently.
- Modern development practices: You prefer modern development practices such as dependency injection, asynchronous programming, and modular architecture. ASP.NET Core supports these practices out of the box.
- Cross-platform requirements: You need to develop applications that run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. ASP.NET Core’s cross-platform capabilities make it an excellent choice for diverse environments.
- Cloud integration: You plan to deploy your applications to the cloud. ASP.NET Core integrates seamlessly with Azure and other cloud platforms, simplifying deployment and management.
- Microservices architecture: You're building a microservices-based architecture. ASP.NET Core’s lightweight and modular design is well-suited for microservices.
- API development: You need to develop robust API services. ASP.NET Core supports both RESTful APIs and gRPC, providing flexibility for different communication needs.
- Rich user interfaces: You want to build interactive and dynamic web applications. With support for Blazor, React, Angular, and Vue, ASP.NET Core allows you to create rich user interfaces.
- Security and compliance: You require strong security features and compliance with industry standards. ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for HTTPS, data protection, and other security best practices.

## When ASP.NET Core might not be a good fit

ASP.NET Core might not be a good fit for your web development needs when your web app has any of these requirements:

- Minimal requirements: Your application is a simple static page site.
- Specific language preferences: Your team prefers working with languages other than C#. While ASP.NET Core supports multiple languages, it's primarily designed for C# development.
