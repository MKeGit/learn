ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications. This open-source framework allows developers to create web applications, services, and APIs that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is built for large-scale app development and can handle any size workload, making it a robust choice for enterprise-level applications.

# Modular architecture

ASP.NET Coreâ€™s modular architecture offers a flexible approach to modern web development. This architecture includes support for dependency injection, middleware, configuration, and logging. Middleware components can be configured to handle requests and responses, including built-in middleware for authentication, routing, session management, and static file serving. The dependency injection design pattern enhances testability and maintainability.

# Full stack web development

ASP.NET Core is a full stack web framework that seamlessly integrates frontend and backend development needs within a single consistent framework. For frontend development, ASP.NET Core includes Blazor, a component-based web UI framework based on C# that supports both server-side rendering and client-side rendering via WebAssembly. Alternatively, ASP.NET Core can be integrated with JavaScript frontend frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.

# API development

ASP.NET Core is also a powerful framework for API development. It supports creating JSON-based APIs, gRPC services, and real-time services using SignalR. With built-in OpenAPI support, developers can easily generate and visualize API documentation, simplifying the design and consumption of APIs. You can use ASP.NET Core to build backend APIs for a variety of apps, including web apps and native mobile apps.

# Security built-in

Additionally, ASP.NET Core helps you build secure applications thanks to its robust built-in security features for authentication and authorization. These features help applications manage user identities and protect sensitive data effectively.

# Productivity

Overall, ASP.NET Core provides a productive development experience, enabling developers to build high-quality full stack web apps efficiently and effectively.
