ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled, Internet-connected apps.

## Key features and benefits

ASP.NET Core equips developers to handle a wide range of modern web development scenarios with the following features and benefits:

### Versatile application development

- **Build modern web apps**: Create dynamic, responsive web applications that cater to a wide range of business needs. ASP.NET Core supports features like MVC and Blazor which enabling you to build interactive web UIs as reusable components using C#. Blazor also allows for code sharing between client and server, providing a seamless development experience.
- **Build robust API services**: Supports both RESTful APIs and gRPC. RESTful APIs are widely used for their simplicity and compatibility with web standards, while gRPC offers high performance and efficient communication, making it ideal for real-time applications and microservices.
- **Develop Internet of Things (IoT) apps**: Utilize ASP.NET Core to connect and manage IoT devices, enabling real-time data processing and interaction. The framework’s cross-platform capabilities make it ideal for IoT solutions.
- **Create mobile backends**: Support mobile applications with robust back-end services, ensuring seamless data synchronization and user management. ASP.NET Core’s flexibility allows you to build APIs that will be consumed by mobile apps.
- **Deploy to the cloud or on-premises**: Flexibly deploy your applications to cloud platforms such as Azure, or host them on your own servers. ASP.NET Core’s integration with Azure services simplifies cloud deployment and management.
- **Integrate with additional front-end frameworks**: Seamlessly work with popular front-end technologies like React, Angular, and Vue to build rich, interactive user interfaces. ASP.NET Core’s support for these frameworks allows for the creation of sophisticated client-side applications.
- **Run on .NET, run cross-platform**: Benefit from a cross-platform framework that allows you to develop and run applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux. .NET provides a high-performance runtime environment, extensive libraries, and a strong ecosystem, ensuring your applications are performant, secure, and scalable.

### Robust architecture

- **Modular middleware**: Offers a modular approach to middleware, including components for authentication, authorization, logging, real-time communication, and more. These can be easily integrated into your application to extend its functionality.
- **Utilize a modular architecture**: Incorporate middleware components for authentication, authorization, logging, and real-time communication, allowing you to customize and extend your application as needed. ASP.NET Core’s middleware pipeline is highly - configurable and extensible.
- **Built for high performance and scalability**: Optimize your applications with built-in support for caching, asynchronous programming, and other performance-enhancing features. ASP.NET Core is designed to handle high traffic and large-scale applications efficiently.
- **Maintain security and compliance**: Implement best practices for security, including HTTPS, data protection, and compliance with industry standards. ASP.NET Core provides robust security features to protect your applications and data.

### Development flexibility

- **Unified framework**: Build both server-side and client-side components using a single development stack. Share code for common logic between the client and server, streamlining your development process.
- **Flexible development styles**: Supports a wide range of development styles, such as MVC, Web APIs, or Blazor. Blazor lets you build reusable interactive web UI components using C# that can run on WebAssembly (client-side) or on the server.
- **Front-end integration**: Seamlessly integrate with popular front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. This flexibility allows you to choose the best tools for your project while applying ASP.NET Core’s robust backend capabilities.
- **Use your favorite development tools**: Leverage powerful development environments like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code on Windows, macOS, and Linux. These tools provide comprehensive support for ASP.NET Core development, including debugging, testing, and deployment.
