Your team lead asked you to publish your team's app in a few different ways. 

First, you published the app as a framework-dependent deployment. This means that the app requires the .NET Core runtime to be installed on the target machine. Next, you published the app as a self-contained deployment for Windows and again for Linux. The self-contained deployment, though, is much larger because it includes the .NET runtime with the app.

Congratulations! You're now ready to deploy your app to a variety of environments. You can deploy your app to a web server, a container, or to Azure. You can even deploy your app to a Raspberry Pi running Linux. The possibilities are endless!
