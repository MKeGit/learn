quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "What statement is most accurate about the `OrderStatusHub` class?" 
      choices:
        - content: "It's an implementation of `Hub<IOrderStatusHub>`."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The hub from the code refactoring implements the 'strongly typed' `Hub<TClient>`."
        - content: "It's an implementation of `HubConnection`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The `HubConnection` is a client-side concept."
        - content: "It's an implementation of `Hub`."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although this statement is partially true, the hub implements the 'strongly typed' `Hub<TClient>`."

    - content: "Why was SignalR a preferred alternative to client-side polling?"
      choices:
        - content: "No reason whatsoever. They're functionally equivalent."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although the two are functionally equivalent, with SignalR, changes are broadcast to clients only as needed."
        - content: "At peak business hours, orders were lost because the server was flooded with requests."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! With SignalR, changes are broadcast to clients only as needed."
        - content: "It's a personal preference. Client-side polling isn't a preferred alternative."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although the two are functionally equivalent, with SignalR, changes are broadcast to clients only as needed."

    - content: "With a SignalR connection, which of the following statements is true?"
      choices:
        - content: "Both client and server can send messages (duplex communication)."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! SignalR creates a duplex communication, in which the server and client can send messages to each other."
        - content: "Clients can send messages to the server, but the server can't send messages to clients."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. SignalR creates a duplex communication, in which the server and client can send messages to each other."
        - content: "The server can send messages to clients, but clients can't send messages to the server."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. SignalR creates a duplex communication, in which the server and client can send messages to each other."

    - content: "As part of the refactoring, what parts of the code had to change?"
      choices:
        - content: "Only the client-side code. The server-side code was already functionally sound."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The server-side code had to map and configure the `OrderStatusHub` class."
        - content: "Only the server-side code. The client-side code was already functionally sound."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. The client-side code had to consume `HubConnection` to communicate with the server."
        - content: "Both the client-side code and server-side code were updated as part of the refactoring."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct! The client-side code used `HubConnection` to connect to the server-side `OrderStatusHub` class."
