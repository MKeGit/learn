In this module, you explored how to build a front-end app. You considered that different teams might be involved in creating front-end app and back-end API. For example, if the back-end team takes time implementing its parts, you learned that you might need to rely on mocked data while you wait.

After that, we approached the fact that front-end app and back-end API could be created by different teams. If, for example, the back-end team takes time to implement their parts, then you might need to rely on mocked data.

Finally, we discussed how to connect the front-end app and back-end API and how you initially would run into problems with CORS. CORS is really about protecting your API from requests from domains that aren't allowed. By configuring CORS properly, you can make your back-end server allowlist the domain your front-end app is running on.
