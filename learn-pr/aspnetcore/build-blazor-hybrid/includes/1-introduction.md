Blazor lets C# developers use their skills to build web apps with C#. Blazor Hybrid allows developers to use Blazor web UI components (called Razor components) from within native mobile and desktop client apps. Blazor Hybrid apps use a "hybrid" of web and native client development.

Blazor Hybrid supports using Razor components with:

- .NET MAUI (Multi-Platform User Interface)
- Windows Forms (WinForms)
- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

Imagine you're building a client-side web app and already have a team of .NET web developers. Also, imagine you want to deploy your app as a native multiplatform app across mobile and desktop platforms including iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

With Blazor, developers can build front-end and back-end logic for web apps with common languages, frameworks, and tools. With .NET MAUI, you can build multi-platform apps from a single project and access platform-specific source code and resources for mobile and desktop platforms. Combining these two technologies together with Blazor Hybrid, developers can build native-client and web apps that leverage shared UI components and logic. They can use Blazor Hybrid for the entire native application or parts of the native application.

Using the same language for front-end web apps, client apps, and back-end code can:

- Accelerate app development.
- Reduce the complexity of the build pipeline.
- Simplify maintenance.
- Let developers understand and work on both client-side and server-side code.

## Learning objectives

- Add a Razor component to a Blazor Hybrid page.
- Update logic in a Blazor Hybrid app.
- Learn about event handling and data binding in Blazor components.
- Use routing in a Blazor app.
- Access platform features leveraging .NET MAUI.
