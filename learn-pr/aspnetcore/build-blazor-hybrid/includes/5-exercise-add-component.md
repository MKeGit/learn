In this exercise, you add a Razor component to your application's home page.

## Add the Counter component to the Home page

1. Expand the folders in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer. If you don't have the Solution Explorer displayed, select **View** > **Solution Explorer**.

1. Select **Components/Pages** to view the existing Razor pages.

1. Select the **Home.razor** file to open it.

1. Add a `Counter` component to the page by adding a `<Counter />` element at the end of the _Home.razor_ file.

   ```razor
   @page "/"

   <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

   Welcome to your new app.

   <Counter />
   ```

::: zone pivot="vstudio"

If you still have the app running, save the file and select the **Hot reload** (<kbd>Alt+F10</kbd>) command so that the `Counter` component shows up on the Home page. In the running app, verify the counter appears by selecting another tab, then selecting the **Home** tab to return to the Home page. If you stopped debugging previously, start the app again by selecting **Debug** > **Start Debugging**.

When you're ready to stop, return to Visual Studio and press <kbd>Shift+F5</kbd> to stop the app.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="vscode"

If you still have the app running, return to Visual Studio Code, and press <kbd>Shift+F5</kbd> to stop the app. Save the file and start the app again by selecting **Run** > **Start Debugging**

When you're ready to stop, return to Visual Studio Code, and press <kbd>Shift+F5</kbd> to stop the app.

:::zone-end

## Modify a component

Component parameters are specified using attributes or child content, which allow you to set properties on the child component. Define a parameter on the `Counter` component for specifying how much it increments with every button click:

- Add a public property for `IncrementAmount` with a `[Parameter]` attribute.
- Change the `IncrementCount` method to use the `IncrementAmount` when incrementing the value of `currentCount`.

Update the code in the **Counter.razor** file as follows:

```razor
@page "/counter"

<h1>Counter</h1>

<p role="status">Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    [Parameter]
    public int IncrementAmount { get; set; } = 1;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount += IncrementAmount;
    }
}
```

In `Home.razor`, update the `<Counter>` element to add an `IncrementAmount` attribute that changes the increment amount to 10 as shown by the last line in the following code:

```razor
@page "/"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to your new app.

<Counter IncrementAmount="10" />
```

Start the app again 

The `Home` component now has its own counter that increments by 10 each time you select the **Click me** button, as shown in the following image. The `Counter` component (_Counter.razor_) at `/counter` continues to increment by one.
