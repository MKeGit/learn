In this module, you set up your development environment to create and build a Blazor Hybrid app with .NET MAUI for mobile and desktop. You then:

- Reused a Razor component.
- Added HTML and C# to the Razor file.
- Used binding to sync user input to the todo list logic.
- Accessed platform features to load and save the todo list.

You now understand the fundamentals of building Blazor Hybrid apps. You can use your HTML and C# knowledge to build more complex native apps.
