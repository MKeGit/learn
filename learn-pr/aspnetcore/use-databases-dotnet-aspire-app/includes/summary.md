Congratulations! In this module, you learned about the .NET Aspire components that can be used to connect to both relational and nonrelational databases for data storage and retrieval. You saw how .NET Aspire, through dependency injection, and service discovery, reduces the configuration overhead and makes it easier to connect to databases.

Imagine setting up these containers, and the connections between them, without .NET Aspire. You'd have to write boilerplate code to manage the connections and handle errors. You'd also need to add to _appsettings.json_ and environment variables containing paths, ports, and credentials, and write the configuration code to manage them.

Now that you've completed this module, you can:

- Describe the database systems that .NET Aspire can connect to using built-in components.
- Use .NET Aspire components to read and write data to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server databases.
- Use .NET Aspire components to read and write data to MongoDB databases.
