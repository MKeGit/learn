A cloud-native application is a web application built from small microservices, which make use of common services such as messaging queues to communicate or caches to optimize performance. Cloud-native applications are proven and widely implemented but they can be difficult to architect and build. From version 8 onwards, .NET includes the new .NET Aspire stack, which makes it easier to build cloud-native applications by providing service discovery, common components in NuGet packages, and simple tools for both coding and monitoring apps.

Imagine that you work for an outdoor clothing and equipment company. Your development team is considering whether to use .NET Aspire to develop a new storefront web app for the main customer-facing site. You want to understand how .NET Aspire will help your team and save effort.

In this module, you'll see an overview of the .NET Aspire stack and its components. You'll also examine and run a complete app built with .NET Aspire.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe how .NET Aspire makes it easier to develop cloud-native distributed applications.
- Select the right .NET Aspire component to address a functional requirement in a cloud-native application.
- Use Visual Studio to create and run a new application using .NET Aspire.
