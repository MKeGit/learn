A cloud-native application is a web application built from small microservices, which make use of common services such as messaging queues to communicate or caches to optimize performance. Cloud-native applications are proven and widely implemented but they can be difficult to architect and build. From version 8 onwards, .NET includes the new .NET Aspire stack which makes it easier to build cloud-native applications. The .NET Aspire stack provides service discovery, common integrations in NuGet packages, and simple tools for coding and monitoring apps.

Imagine that you work for an outdoor clothing and equipment company. Your development team is considering whether to use .NET Aspire to develop a new storefront web app for the main customer-facing site. You want to understand how .NET Aspire can help your team and save effort.

In this module, you get an overview of the .NET Aspire stack and its integrations. You also examine and run a complete app built with .NET Aspire.

## Learning objectives

After you complete this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe how .NET Aspire makes it easier to develop cloud-native distributed applications.
- Select the right .NET Aspire integration to address a functional requirement in a cloud-native application.
- Use Visual Studio to create and run a new application using .NET Aspire.
