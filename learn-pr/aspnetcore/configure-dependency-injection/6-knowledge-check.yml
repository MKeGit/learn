      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a true statement, but there is a better answer."
    - content: "ASP.NET Core comes with a built-in service container that supports dependency injection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a true statement, but there is a better answer."
    - content: "ASP.NET Core's service container supports three service lifetimes: transient, scoped, and singleton."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a true statement, but there is a better answer."
    - content: "All of the above."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! All of the above statements are true."
  - content: "What is the behavior or a service registered with the **singleton** service lifetime?"
    choices:
    - content: "A new instance of the service is created for each request."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the behavior of a scoped service."
    - content: "A single instance of the service is created for the lifetime of the app."
      isCorrect: true
