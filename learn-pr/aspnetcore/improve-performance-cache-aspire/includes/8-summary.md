Caching techniques enable engineers to accelerate responses from their web app and Redis is one of the most popular caching solutions. If you're building your app by using .NET Aspire, then it's easy to start using Redis caches because there are caching components available out-of-the-box. In this module, you've seen how to add those components to your solution and use them to optimize performance.

Now that you've completed the module, you can:

- Choose a type of Redis caching for a specific performance optimization requirement.
- Use a Redis distributed cache to increase performance in apps built with .NET Aspire.
- Use a Redis output cache to cache complete HTML responses in apps built with .NET Aspire.
