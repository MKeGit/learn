Azure Virtual Desktop licensing allows you to apply a license to any Windows or Windows Server virtual machine that is registered as a session host in a host pool receiving user connections.

> [!NOTE]
> The license does not apply to virtual machines are running as file share servers or domain controllers.

There are a few ways to use the Azure Virtual Desktop license:

 -  You can create a host pool and its session host virtual machines using the [Azure Marketplace](/azure/virtual-desktop/deploy-azure-virtual-desktop?tabs=portal) offering. Virtual machines created this way automatically have the license applied.
 -  You can create a host pool and its session host virtual machines using the [GitHub Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/ARM-wvd-templates). Virtual machines created this way automatically have the license applied.
 -  You can apply a license to an existing session host virtual machine.

## Apply a Windows license to a session host virtual machine

Run the following PowerShell cmdlet to apply the Windows license:

```PowerShell
$vm = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroup <resourceGroupName> -Name <vmName>
$vm.LicenseType = "Windows_Client"
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -VM $vm

```

## Verify your session host virtual machine is utilizing the licensing benefit

After deploying the virtual machine, run this cmdlet to verify the license type:

```PowerShell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -Name <vmName>

```

A session host virtual machine with the applied Windows license will show you something like this:

```PowerShell
Type                    : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                : westus
LicenseType              : Windows_Client

```

Virtual machines without the applied Windows license will show you something like this:

```PowerShell
Type                    : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                : westus
LicenseType              :

```

Run the following cmdlet to see a list of all session host virtual machines that have the Windows license applied in your Azure subscription:

```PowerShell
$vms = Get-AzVM
$vms | Where-Object {$_.LicenseType -like "Windows_Client"} | Select-Object ResourceGroupName, Name, LicenseType

```
