When you create an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets implementation in the Azure portal, you can enable manual or autoscaling. For optimal performance, you should define a minimum, maximum, and default number of virtual machine instances to use.

In the Azure portal, you can select the scaling mode.

**Scaling mode** 

- **Manually update the capacity**: You can manually update the capacity and maintain a fixed instance count. Set the **Instance count** to the number of virtual machines in the scale set (0 - 1000). Configure the [**Scale-in policy**](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-scale-in-policy) which is the order virtual machines are selected for deletion. For example, you could balance across zones and then delete the virtual machine with the highest instance ID. 

- **Autoscaling**: You can autoscale the capacity on any schedule, based on any metrics. Specify the maximum number of virtual machines that can be available when autoscaling is applied on your implementation.

**Configure autoscaling**

Autoscaling is based on a scaling condition.

- **Default instance count.** The initial number of virtual machines deployed in this scale set (0-1000).

- **Instance limit.** The minimum count of instance you want this condition to scale down to. The maximum count of instance you want this condition to scale up to.

- **Scale out.** The CPU usage percentage threshold for triggering the scale-out autoscale rule. The number of instances to scale out by.

- **Scale in.** The CPU usage percentage threshold for triggering the scale in autoscale rule. The number of instances to scale in by. 

- **Query duration**: This duration is the time the Autoscale engine looks back for the metric usage average. This look back is to allow your metric to stabilize.

- **Schedule**: Specify the start and end dates. You can also repeat the schedule on specific days.
