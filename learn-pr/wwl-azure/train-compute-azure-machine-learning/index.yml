title: Train compute-intensive models with Azure Machine Learning
summary: Train compute-intensive models with GPU compute in Azure Machine Learning. By monitoring workloads, you can find the optimal compute configuration. Distributed training allows you to train on multiple nodes to speed up training time.
abstract: |
  In this module, you'll learn:
  - How to train a model with GPUs in Azure Machine Learning.
  - When to use which GPU option.
  - How to distribute model training.
prerequisites: |
  Before starting this module, you should be familiar with the Azure Machine Learning service and training machine learning and deep learning models.
