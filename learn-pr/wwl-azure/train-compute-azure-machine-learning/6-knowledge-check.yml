quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist wants to train a deep learning model. To allow for experimentation with datasets and algorithms, which GPU compute should be made available to the data scientist?"
    choices:
    - content: "A low-priority compute cluster."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A low-priority compute cluster will automatically scale down when idle and is more cost-efficient than a dedicated cluster."
    - content: "A dedicated compute cluster."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A dedicated cluster isn't the most cost-efficient option."
    - content: "A compute instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Though a compute instance may be more user-friendly for the data scientist, the instance doesn't automatically scale down when idle and may result in wasted resources."
  - content: "Which approach should be used to monitor the GPU usage of a specific Azure Machine Learning run?"
    choices:
    - content: "Explore the metrics of the Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The metrics in the portal won't show details for each run."
    - content: "Explore the Details tab of the run in the Azure Machine Learning studio."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Details will show the compute duration for the run, but not the GPU usage."
    - content: "Explore the Monitoring tab of the run in the Azure Machine Learning studio."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Monitoring tab will show the average GPU utilization for the run."
