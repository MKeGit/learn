        As a result of Executive Order 13800, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) was tasked with compiling an annual [Federal Government IT Modernization Report](https://www.cio.gov/assets/resources/Report-to-the-President-on-IT-Modernization-Final.pdf) to lay out a strategy for Federal Government IT modernization.

        The report first focuses on network modernization, and seeks to "maximize secure use of cloud computing, modernize Government-hosted applications, and securely maintain legacy systems."

        The report prioritizes the modernization of “High Risk, High Value Assets”, which it refers to as HVAs.

        These HVAs are specifically called out because of the risk their lack of modernization presents to the security of the United States.

### Modernization of the TIC initiative

The report calls for the modernization of Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) to more relevant, modern standards. It notes that network security policies must allow agencies to focus on both network and data-level security and privacy.

It also calls for the modernization of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS) Program to enable cloud migration.

### Consolidate network acquisitions and management

The report calls for the consolidation and standardization of procurement and acquisition to benefit from economies of scale.

## Shared services for future network architectures

The second major focus is shared services to enable future network architectures.

### Promote the usage of commercial cloud

The report calls for improving contract vehicles so that agencies may acquire commercial cloud products that meet the standards of the Government.

### Accelerate adoption of cloud email and collaboration

The report recommends enabling shared services and future network architectures through the use of commercial cloud providers, and also  pushes for the accelerated adoption of cloud email and collaboration tools across all of Federal IT.

### Improvement of existing shared services and their security

The report calls for improving existing shared services, but also providing better visibility into their security and their underpinning technology. 

## Resourcing federal network IT modernization

To achieve these goals, the report acknowledges that the federal resources also must be modernized.

### Examination of agency contracts

The report recommends that CIOs, CFOs, and SAOPs re-examine existing agency contracts and determine the best path forward for strategizing toward modernization. It recommends re-prioritizing funds and potentially stopping funding legacy systems, and instead using that funding toward modern technologies, cloud solutions, and shared services.

## Importance

This report was developed in conjunction with the American Technology Council (ATC), which President Trump created on May 1, 2017, and is a public-private partnership that is now part of the ACT-IAC. The ACT-IAC has existed since the 1970s, and emphasizes how the government may learn from private industry.

This report is heavily focused on network modernization and shared services, underscoring cybersecurity though out most sections.
