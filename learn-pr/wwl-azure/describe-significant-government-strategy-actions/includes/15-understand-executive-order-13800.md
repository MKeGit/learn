        On May 11, 2017, President Trump issued [Executive Order 13800](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2017-05-16/pdf/2017-10004.pdf), titled “Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure.”

        This executive order, or EO, is noteworthy because the United States has increasingly seen a rise in the number of cyberattacks on not just government entities, but on private businesses.

        While government entities are oftentimes targets, hackers oftentimes use ransomware to attack the networks of private companies and then extort money from them.

        This executive order seeks to improve the Nation’s cyber posture and capabilities in the face of intensifying cybersecurity threats.

        The EO begins by addressing accountability. It notes that Federal IT exists to serve the needs of the people, and that the President will hold agency heads accountable for the cybersecurity of its information technology (IT).

### Report on risk

The EO candidly states that "the executive branch has for too long accepted antiquated and difficult-to-defend IT." It cites a lack of planning to maintain, improve, and modernize IT. Again, it notes that agency heads will be accountable to the President for not proactively addressing IT and the risk management mechanisms they must put into place must be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of the potential harm that could be caused.

It tasks each agency head with using [*The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity*](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/cswp/nist.cswp.04162018.pdf) developed by NIST. Then, it sets a 90 day time frame for each agency head to deliver a risk management report to both the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of OMB. The reports are to be used to plan for assessing the cyber risk, asking for more budget, and putting into place mechanisms to address any cyber risks.

### Declaration of modernization as policy, and report on modernization

The EO notes that "effective immediately, it's the policy of the executive branch to build and maintain a modern, secure, and more resilient executive branch IT architecture."

To implement this approach, agency heads are to favor shared IT services in procurement, specifically toward email, cloud, and cybersecurity.

The Director of the American Technology Council is also tasked with creating a report within 90 days on consolidating all federal agencies, except national/regional security ones, to consolidated network architectures and shared IT services.

## Cybersecurity of critical infrastructure

The executive order notes that support to critical infrastructure is at the greatest risk to the United States. It identifies several parties who play a key role in mitigating risk to critical infrastructure, and tasks them with compiling a report, within 180 days, that includes findings and recommendations for better supporting the cybersecurity risk management efforts of critical infrastructure, and to also do so on an annual basis.

The EO also requires the creation of a report by the Secretary of Homeland security on *Supporting Transparency in the Marketplace* of risk management solutions, and later tasks the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to lead a process on *Resilience Against Botnets and Other Automated, Distributed Threats.*

The EO tasks the Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Homeland Security to  assess *Electricity Disruption Incident Response Capabilities* and provide a report within 90 days.

Finally, the EO tasks the Secretary of Defense, Homeland Security, and the Director of the FBI to create a report within 90 days of cybersecurity risks facing the defense industrial base, its supply chain, military platforms, systems, networks, and capabilities.

## Cybersecurity for the Nation

The EO recognizes the importance of the Internet as it was in 2017 and what it will be in the future, noting it's the basis of efficiency, innovation, communication and economic prosperity, but must be safeguarded against disruption, fraud, and theft.

The EO tasks several parties with creation of another report within 90 days on deterring adversaries and better protecting the American people from cyber threats.

The EO tasks several parties with creation of a report on *International Cooperation*, specifically on how the United States should best work together with other countries/regions to support investigation, attribution, cyber threat information sharing, response, capacity building, and cooperation.

The EO tasks the Secretaries of Commerce and Homeland Security with providing a report within 120 days on how to upskill Federal workforce employees and ensure their skills are kept up to date. The Department of National Intelligence, in collaboration with several other parties, must assess the findings of the report and provide recommendations and a plan on how best to implement the workforce development efforts.

## Importance

The EO focuses Federal efforts on modernizing Federal information technology infrastructure, working with state and local government and private sector partners to more fully secure critical infrastructure, and collaborating with foreign allies.

Though it's very report and task heavy, this Executive Order is comprehensive and highlights the numerous efforts the Executive Branch believes to be of importance in securing Federal networks, critical infrastructure, and the prosperity of the United States.

Lastly, it requires the Federal CIO to compile a Federal Government IT Modernization report.
