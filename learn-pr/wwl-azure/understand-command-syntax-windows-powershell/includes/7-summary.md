In this module, you've learned about the cmdlet structure and the parameters for using Windows PowerShell cmdlets. You've also learned how to use tab completion and how to display **About** files content. The following are the key takeaways:

 -  The common structure cmdlet creators use, is the Verb-Noun format. This helps you predict both a cmdlet's name and its syntax, thus making it much easier to discover and use cmdlets.
 -  Parameters modify the actions that a cmdlet performs. You can specify no parameters, one parameter, or many parameters for a cmdlet.
 -  Tab completion is a PowerShell feature that improves the speed and ease of finding and entering cmdlets and parameters.
 -  In addition to the help content relating to commands, **About** help files contain documentation about the PowerShell scripting language, operators, and other details. This information doesn't specifically relate to a single command, but to global shell techniques and features.
