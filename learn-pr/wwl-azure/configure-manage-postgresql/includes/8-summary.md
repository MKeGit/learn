You should now understand how to view system information to gain deeper insight into how to administer Azure Database for PostgreSQL databases. You learned how to find information about **vacuum** and **autovacuum** configuration. How to identify where you can reclaim lost space by removing rows marked for deletion. You also learned about the other benefits of running vacuum, and how to configure the relevant server parameters.
