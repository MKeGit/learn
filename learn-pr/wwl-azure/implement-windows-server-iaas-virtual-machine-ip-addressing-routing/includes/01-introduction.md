In this module, you’ll learn how to manage Microsoft Azure virtual networks (VNets). You'll also manage IP address configuration for Windows Server IaaS virtual machines (VMs).

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts. Contoso IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2019.
Contoso’s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology.  The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization. 

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals. 
Of particular interest is understanding Azure networking, and especially how Azure VMs can make the most of Azure networking. You establish a pilot to examine virtual networking in Azure, and how it manages IP addressing, routing, and the interaction between public and private address spaces.

In this module, you'll implement an Azure VNet and IP address allocation in Azure. You'll assign and manage IPv4 addressing, and create a VM with a static IP address. You will also implement both IaaS VM routing and IPv6 settings.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Implement an Azure VNet
- Implement IP Address Allocation in Azure
- Assign and manage IP addresses
- Configure a private IP address for an Azure VM
- Create a VM with a static IP address
- Implement IaaS VM IP routing
- Implement IPv6 for Windows IaaS VMs



## Prerequisites

To get the best learning experience from this module, it's important that you have knowledge and experience of the following areas:

- Managing Windows Server operating system and Windows Server workloads in on-premises scenarios, including AD DS, DNS, Distributed File System (DFS), Microsoft Hyper-V, and file and storage services.
- Common Windows Server management tools.
