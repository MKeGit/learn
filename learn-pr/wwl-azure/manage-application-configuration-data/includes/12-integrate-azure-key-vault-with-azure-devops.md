**Estimated time:** 40 minutes.

## Scenario

Azure Key Vault provides secure storage and management of sensitive data, such as keys, passwords, and certificates. Azure Key Vault includes support for hardware security modules and a range of encryption algorithms and key lengths. Using Azure Key Vault can minimize the possibility of disclosing sensitive data through source code, a common mistake developers make. Access to Azure Key Vault requires proper authentication and authorization, supporting fine-grained permissions to its content.

In this lab, you see how you can integrate Azure Key Vault with an Azure Pipeline by using the following steps:

 -  Create an Azure Key vault to store an ACR password as a secret.
 -  Create a Service Principal to access Azure Key Vault's secrets.
 -  Configure permissions to allow the Service Principal to read the secret.
 -  Configure the pipeline to retrieve the password from the Azure Key Vault and pass it on to subsequent tasks.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

 -  Create a Microsoft Entra ID Service Principal.
 -  Create an Azure Key Vault.

## Requirements

 -  This lab requires **Microsoft Edge** or an [Azure DevOps-supported browser](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).
 -  **Set up an Azure DevOps organization:** If you don't already have an Azure DevOps organization that you can use for this lab, create one by following the instructions available at [Create an organization or project collection](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization).
 -  Identify an existing Azure subscription or create a new one.
 -  Verify that you have a Microsoft account or Microsoft Entra account with the Owner role in the Azure subscription and the Global Administrator role associated with the Azure subscription. For details, refer to [List Azure role assignments using the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal) and [View and assign administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/manage-roles-portal#view-my-roles).

## Exercises

During this lab, you complete the following exercises:

 -  Exercise 0: Configure the lab prerequisites.
 -  Exercise 1: Set up CI Pipeline to build eShopOnWeb container.
 -  Exercise 2: Remove the Azure lab resources.
