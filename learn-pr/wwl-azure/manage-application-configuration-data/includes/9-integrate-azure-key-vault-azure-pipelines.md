Applications contain many secrets, such as:

 -  Connection strings.
 -  Passwords.
 -  Certificates.
 -  Tokens, which, if leaked to unauthorized users, can lead to a severe security breach.

It can result in severe damage to the organization's reputation and compliance issues with different governing bodies.

Azure Key Vault allows you to manage your organization's secrets and certificates in a centralized repository.

The secrets and keys are further protected by Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

It also provides versioning of secrets, full traceability, and efficient permission management with access policies.
