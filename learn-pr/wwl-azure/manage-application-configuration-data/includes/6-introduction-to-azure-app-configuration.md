Azure App Configuration is a service for central management of application settings and feature flags.

Modern programs include distributed components, each that needs its settings.

It's prevalent with microservice-based applications and with serverless applications.

Distributed configuration settings can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot deployment errors.

Azure App Configuration service stores all the settings for your application and secures their access in one place.

Azure App Configuration service provides the following features:

 -  A fully managed service that can be set up in minutes.
 -  Flexible key representations and mappings.
 -  Tagging with labels.
 -  A point-in-time replay of settings.
 -  Dedicated UI for feature flag management.
 -  Comparison of two sets of configurations on custom-defined dimensions.
 -  Enhanced security through Azure managed identities.
 -  Complete data encryptions, at rest or in transit.
 -  Native integration with popular frameworks.

App Configuration complements Azure Key Vault, which is used to store application secrets. App Configuration makes it easier to implement the following scenarios:

 -  Centralize management and distribution of hierarchical configuration data for different environments and geographies.
 -  Dynamically change application settings without the need to redeploy or restart an application.
 -  Control feature availability in real time.
