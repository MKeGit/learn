In this module, we explore the monitoring solutions available in Azure. We assess Azure Monitor and its features, such as Application Insights and Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics) to analyze infrastructure and application performance and availability.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

:::image type="icon" source="../media/tailwind-traders.png" border="false":::

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. The company operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online.

As you work through this module, suppose you work for Tailwind Traders, and they're moving their systems to Azure with a mixture of IaaS and PaaS services. In the current environment, the organization had several instances where application performance was degraded, or systems became entirely unavailable. There was an extended delay to identify and resolve the issues. This situation affected the customer's ability to access their accounts and led to poor user satisfaction.

The organization wants to design a monitoring strategy that performs full-stack monitoring across all solutions that it uses. There should also be insights and alerting into the collected data. The organization wants to quickly identify and minimize poor performance and system failures in the future. The practice of continuous monitoring must include analysis of platform metrics and logs to get visibility into the health and performance of services that are part of the architecture.
