## Tips for Azure Advisor

 -  Make sure to check your recommendations frequently, at least more than once a week. Azure Advisor updates its active recommendations multiple times per day. Checking for new recommendations can prevent larger issues by helping you spot and solve smaller ones.
 -  Always try to solve the issues with the highest priority level in Azure Advisor. High priority issues are marked with red. Leaving high-priority recommendations unresolved can lead to problems down the line.
 -  If a recommendation seems less important, you can dismiss it or postpone it.
 -  Don't dismiss recommendations until you know why they're appearing and are sure it won't have a negative impact on you or your users.
