Use the Performance Diagnostics tool to identify and troubleshoot performance issues on your Azure virtual machine (VM) in one of two modes:

 -  Continuous diagnostics (preview) collects data at five-second intervals and reports actionable insights about high resource usage every five minutes.
 -  On-demand diagnostics helps you troubleshoot an ongoing performance issue with more in-depth data, insights, and recommendations based on data collected at a single point in time.

Performance Diagnostics stores all insights and reports in a storage account, which you can configure for short data retention to minimize costs.

Run Performance Diagnostics directly from the Azure portal, where you can also review insights and a report on various logs, rich configuration, and diagnostics data. We recommend that you run Performance Diagnostics and review the insights and diagnostics data before you contact Microsoft Support.

This unit explains how to use Performance Diagnostics and what the continuous and on-demand modes offer.

The following operating systems are currently supported for both on-demand and continuous diagnostics:

 -  Windows Server 2022
 -  Windows Server 2019
 -  Windows Server 2016
 -  Windows Server 2012 R2
 -  Windows Server 2012
 -  Windows 11
 -  Windows 10
