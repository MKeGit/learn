The term governance describes the general process of establishing rules and policies. Governance ensures those rules and policies are enforced.

A good governance strategy helps you maintain control over the applications and resources that you manage in the cloud. Maintaining control over your environment ensures that you stay compliant with:

- Industry standards, such as information security management.

- Corporate or organizational standards, such as ensuring that network data is encrypted.

Governance is most beneficial when you have:

- Multiple engineering teams working in Azure.

- Multiple subscriptions to manage.

- Regulatory requirements that must be enforced.

- Standards that must be followed for all cloud resources.
