There are several best practices to effectively use versions, views, and promotion flow for your versioning strategy.

Here's a couple of suggestions:

 -  Have a documented versioning strategy.
 -  Adopt SemVer 2.0 for your versioning scheme.
 -  Each repository should only reference one feed.
 -  On package creation, automatically publish packages back to the feed.

It's good to adopt a best practice yourself and share these with your development teams.

It can be made part of the Definition of Done for work items related to publishing and consuming packages from feeds.
