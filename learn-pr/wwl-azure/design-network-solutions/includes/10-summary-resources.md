In this module, you learned how to evaluate and design an effective network architecture solution based on workload requirements. You reviewed features and benefits of several Azure Services, including Azure Bastion, Web Application Firewall, Front Door, and Virtual WAN. You explored how to design a solution for on-premises connectivity to Azure Virtual Networks and Azure network connectivity services. You discovered how to create a solution for application delivery services and protection services.
