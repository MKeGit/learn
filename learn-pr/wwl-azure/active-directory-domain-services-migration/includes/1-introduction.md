The first step in moving your organization’s Active Directory Domain Services domain controllers to Windows Server 2025 is to determine whether you want to upgrade your existing domains and forest or migrate to a newly deployed forest. If you decide to upgrade your existing domains and forest, you need to know the steps required to introduce and then switch over to Windows Server 2025 domain controllers.
