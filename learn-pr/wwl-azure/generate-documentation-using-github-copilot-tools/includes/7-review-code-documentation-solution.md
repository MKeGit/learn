Your challenge was to create inline code comments and project documentation for an existing app using GitHub Copilot Chat. This review describes the GitHub Copilot Chat features and prompts used to complete the challenge.

> [!NOTE]
> The responses generated by GitHub Copilot Chat are based on chat history and the context provided by the user. Other factors, such as AI model updates, also influence responses. Your results should be similar to the results shown in this solution, with variations expected.

The following sections show one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

## Inline documentation for the Program.cs file

The inline documentation challenge was completed using inline chat and the `Generate Docs` smart action. Inline chat used the `/doc` slash command without any further natural language text in the prompt.

To generate inline documentation for the properties and methods of the Device class:

1. Select the code block containing the Device class properties and methods.

    Position the cursor on the code line after the class declaration.

1. Right-click, select **Copilot**, and then select **Generate Docs**.

    Wait for the documentation to be generated. It took about 10 seconds to generate the documentation.

1. Review the suggested changes.

    No issues were found in the generated documentation.

1. Select **Accept**.

1. Continue selecting **Accept** until all suggested changes are accepted.

To generate inline documentation for the Device class:

1. Select the code line containing the Device class declaration.

1. Press `Ctrl` + `I` to open the inline chat.

1. Enter `/doc` in the chat window.

1. Review the suggested changes.

    The generated documentation commented out the class declaration. The backspace key was used to remove the comment characters.

1. Select **Accept**.

These steps resulted in the following documentation for the `Program.cs` file.
