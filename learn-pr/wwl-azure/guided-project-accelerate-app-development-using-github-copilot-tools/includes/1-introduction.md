GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that accelerates the development process. It's powered by OpenAI's Codex, a machine learning model trained on a diverse range of public code repositories. GitHub Copilot can explain and document code, suggest code line completions, and generate methods or classes based on natural language prompts and the context of your codebase.

Suppose you're a software developer working for a regional IT department. Most of the applications that you work on support the local community. Recently, the library's servers were damaged in an accident, and it will take weeks to get the authorization to replace them. The library needs a temporary solution to record book loans and returns. You have three days to develop a temporary solution that will allow the library to reopen. You'll use GitHub Copilot to help you get the work done as efficiently as possible.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Explaining unfamiliar code and generating documentation using GitHub Copilot.
- Developing new app features using GitHub Copilot.
- Creating unit tests using GitHub Copilot.
- Refactoring and improving code using GitHub Copilot.
