As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. With the increasing demand for everyone to become more technically skilled the AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This may be your students' first introduction to the cloud and this course serves as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. 

Before we begin, make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum. It's recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/mctnews/current-courseware-downloading-process/4196123) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module. 
 
Now that you have the updated materials, youâ€™re ready to prepare for your class.
