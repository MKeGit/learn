Azure Architects need to design and recommend data integration solutions to support cloud migration strategies. The cloud data solution must be designed to handle the ingestion, processing, and analysis of data that's too large and complex for traditional database systems. 

## Meet Tailwind Traders

:::image type="icon" source="../media/tailwind-traders.png":::

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. The company specializes in hardware manufacturing, and operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The storage infrastructure holds various data types, including product volume stock, historical data, and production logs. The implementation also supports data streaming from real-time critical manufacturing processes and quality control statistics.

As you work through this lesson, suppose you're the CTO for Tailwind Traders. You're tasked with analyzing and architecting a cloud data solution to handle data that's too large and complex for traditional database systems. You're asked to determine the best approach to combine data from multiple sources. The solution must be able to reformat data into analytical models, and save the models for querying, reporting, and visualization.
