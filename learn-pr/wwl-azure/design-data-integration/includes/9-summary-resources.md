- As an Azure solution architect, I'm looking to design a data integration solution. What are my options within Azure and the use cases for them?

- Explain the key differences between Azure data integration services and Azure data analytics services. Provide two real-world examples for each service, focusing on scenarios where they would be most effectively applied?

- I'm an Azure Solution Architect tasked with designing a data integration solution that handles both batch and real-time data. We need to integrate data from SQL databases, NoSQL stores, and IoT streams into a central data warehouse and a data lake for analytics. The solution must support high-volume data transfers and complex transformations while adhering to strict compliance and security standards. What services would you recommend, and what are the typical use cases for each?
