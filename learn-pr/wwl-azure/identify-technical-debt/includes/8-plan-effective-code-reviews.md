Most developers would agree that code reviews can improve the quality of the applications they produce, but only if the process for the code reviews is effective. It is essential, upfront, to agree that everyone is trying to achieve better code quality.

Achieving code quality can seem to challenge because there's no single best way to write any piece of code, at least code with any complexity. Everyone wants to do good work and to be proud of what they create.

It means that it's easy for developers to become over-protective of their code. The organizational culture must let all involved feel that the code reviews are more like mentoring sessions where ideas about improving code are shared than interrogation sessions where the aim is to identify problems and blame the author.

The knowledge-sharing that can occur in mentoring-style sessions can be one of the most important outcomes of the code review process. It often happens best in small groups (even two people) rather than in large team meetings. And it's important to highlight what has been done well, not just what needs improvement.

Developers will often learn more in effective code review sessions than they'll in any formal training. Reviewing code should be an opportunity for all involved to learn, not just as a chore that must be completed as part of a formal process.

It's easy to see two or more people working on a problem and think that one person could have completed the task by themselves. That is a superficial view of the longer-term outcomes.

Team management needs to understand that improving the code quality reduces the cost of code, not increases it. Team leaders need to establish and foster an appropriate culture across their teams.
