ExpressRoute lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to various Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365. Connectivity can be from an any-to-any (IP VPN) network, a point-to-point Ethernet network, or a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility. Since ExpressRoute connections  don't travel over the public Internet, this approach allows ExpressRoute connections to offer more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latencies, and higher security.
