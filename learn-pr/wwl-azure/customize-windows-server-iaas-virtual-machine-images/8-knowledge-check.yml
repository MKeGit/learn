  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following procedures should an administrator employ to generalize a Windows VM in preparation for creating a managed image in Azure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run **Sysprep.exe** and accept the default values."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Using the default values isn't appropriate. The VM won't be generalized."
    - content: "Run **Sysprep.exe** and select the **Generalize** check box."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The VM will be generalized, but will restart by default."
    - content: "Run **Sysprep.exe**, select the **Generalize** check box, and then in the **Shutdown Options** list, select **Shutdown**."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Generalize isn't selected by default. Also, the default shutdown option is **Reboot**."
  - content: "What is the first step an administrator needs to perform when creating a managed image from a generalized VM that is in the **Stopped (deallocated)** status?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create the image."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The creation takes place after the image is captured."
    - content: "Capture the image."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The administrator must capture the image after it's been generalized and is stopped and deallocated."
    - content: "Start the VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The VM must be in the status Stopped (deallocated)."
  - content: "Which of the following Azure CLI commands should an administrator run to start an image build using Azure Image Builder?"
    choices:
    - content: "`az resource create`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This command submits image configuration to Azure Image Builder."
    - content: "`az resource invoke-action`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This command starts the image build process."
    - content: "`az vm create`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This command builds the VM from the image in Azure Image Builder."
