  - content: "Which of the following choices represents when using this approach the methodology of HOW a state is achieved is abstracted away?"
    choices:
    - content: "Declarative."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In the declarative approach, the script states the how for the final state of the machine by executing the steps to get to the finished state."
    - content: "Imperative."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Imperative approach states what the final state should be."
    - content: "Exclamatory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are two main methods of approach: Declarative and Imperative."
  - content: "Which of the following choices is defines the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome every time?"
    choices:
    - content: "Increment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Idempotence is a mathematical term that can be used in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code. It's the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome."
    - content: "Idempotence."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Idempotence is a mathematical term that can be used in Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code. It's the ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome."
