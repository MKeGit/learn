Technical debt can be classified as the measure between the codebase's current state and an optimal state.

Technical debt saps productivity by making code hard to understand, easy to break, and difficult to validate, creating unplanned work and ultimately blocking progress.

Technical debt is inevitable! It starts small and grows over time through rushed changes, lack of context, and discipline.

Organizations often find that more than 50% of their capacity is sapped by technical debt.

The hardest part of fixing technical debt is knowing where to start.

SonarQube is an open-source platform that is the de facto solution for understanding and managing technical debt.

We'll learn how to use SonarQube in a build pipeline to identify technical debt in this recipe.

## Getting ready

SonarQube is an open platform to manage code quality.

Originally famous in the Java community, SonarQube now supports over 20 programming languages.

The joint investments made by Microsoft and SonarSource make SonarQube easier to integrate with Pipelines and better at analyzing .NET-based applications.

You can read more about the capabilities offered by SonarQube here: [https://www.sonarqube.org/](https://www.sonarqube.org/).

SonarSource, the company behind SonarQube, offers a hosted SonarQube environment called as SonarCloud.
