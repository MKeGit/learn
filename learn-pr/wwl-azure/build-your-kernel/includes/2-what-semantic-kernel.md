Semantic Kernel is an open source SDK that empowers developers to build their own custom artificially intelligent (AI) agents. By combining large language models (LLMs) with native code, developers can create AI agents that understand and respond to natural language prompts to complete a variety of tasks.

## What's an AI agent?

An AI agent is a program that can achieve predetermined goals. AI agents are powered by large language models (LLMs) that are trained on massive amounts of data. An AI agent can fulfill a wide variety of tasks with some or minimal human intervention. AI agents can help you:

- Write code.
- Compose emails.
- Summarize meetings.
- Provide recommendations.
- And the list goes on!

## What's Semantic Kernel?

Semantic Kernel integrates LLMs like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Developers can create "plugins" to interface with the LLMs and perform various tasks. The Semantic Kernel SDK also provides built-in plugins that can quickly enhance an application. Developers can easily utilize LLMs in their own applications without having to learn the intricacies the model's API.

The key components of the Semantic Kernel SDK are:

- AI Orchestration Layer

    The core of the Semantic Kernel stack is an AI orchestration layer that allows the seamless integration of AI models and plugins. This layer is responsible for combining these components to craft innovative user interactions.

- Connectors

    The Semantic Kernel SDK offers a set of connectors that enable developers to integrate LLMs into their existing applications. These connectors serve as the bridge between the application code and the AI models.

- Plugins 

    The Semantic Kernel SDK operates on plugins, essentially serving as the "body" of the AI app. Plugins consist of prompts that you want the AI model to respond to and functions that can complete specialized tasks. Developers can use built-in plugins, or create their own. 

For developers eager to delve into AI development, the Semantic Kernel SDK opens the door to creating your own AI agent. The SDK seamlessly integrates models and custom plugins that enable you to create unique and impactful user experiences.
