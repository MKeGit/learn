A common challenge when developing machine learning models is to prepare for production scenarios. When you write code to process data and train models, you want the code to be scalable, repeatable, and ready for automation.

Though notebooks are ideal for experimentation and development, scripts are a better fit for production workloads. In Azure Machine Learning, you can run a script as a **command job**. When you submit a command job, you can configure various parameters like the input data and the compute environment. Azure Machine Learning also helps you track your work when working with command jobs to make it easier to compare workloads. 

You'll learn how to run a script as a command job using the Python software development kit (SDK) v2 for Azure Machine Learning.

## Learning objectives 

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Convert a notebook to a script.
- Test scripts in a terminal.
- Run a script as a command job.
- Use parameters in a command job.
