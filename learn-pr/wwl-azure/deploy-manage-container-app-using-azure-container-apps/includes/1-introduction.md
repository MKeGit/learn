1. Configure a secure connection between an Azure Container Registry and an Azure Container Apps
1. Create and configure a container app in Azure Container Apps
1. Configure continuous integration by using Azure Pipelines
1. Scale a deployed app in Azure Container Apps
1. Manage revisions in Azure Container Apps
