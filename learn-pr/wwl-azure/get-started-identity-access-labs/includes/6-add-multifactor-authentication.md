As you advance in your role at Contoso, you are now responsible for managing Multifactor Authentication (MFA) settings to enhance the security of user accounts. In this lab, you will enable and disable per-user MFA settings. This ensures users have an additional layer of protection when accessing company resources. You will review MFA settings such as Trusted IPs to allow secure access from specific locations. Finally, you will configure MFA lockout settings to prevent unauthorized access attempts and protect sensitive information. These tasks are crucial for maintaining a secure and resilient identity management system within Microsoft Entra.
