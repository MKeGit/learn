This module provides an introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP), focusing on how to create class definitions and instantiate objects in C#. It compares structured programming to object-oriented programming, examines custom classes in relation to the .NET type system, explores class definitions and constructors, and how to create objects using the `new` operator.

Imagine you're working at a non-profit company and that you've been asked to help update some old software. The volunteers who created the code used structured programming for their original projects. The complexity of the projects has grown, so the team company wants to transition to OOP to take advantage of its benefits like code reusability, modularity, and scalability. However, this transition requires a change in mindset and approach. You need to understand key OOP concepts and how they're implemented in C#, including classes, objects, constructors, and the .NET type system.

The topics covered in this module include:

- Compare structured and object-oriented programming.
- Examine the .NET type system, the difference between value and reference types, and the benefit of using custom class types.
- Design classes using class definitions and namespaces.
- Create class constructors and instantiate objects using the 'new' operator.
- Exercise: Create and objects in C#.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to create classes and instantiate objects using instance constructors and the 'new' operator.
