C# collections are powerful tools for managing groups of objects dynamically, ensuring type safety and efficient data manipulation for various applications.

Imagine you're working in the banking industry, tasked with developing a system that manages customer accounts and transactions. You need a way to store customer IDs linked to their account details, ensure no duplicate transaction records, and maintain an ordered list of recent activities. Without the right tools, this task could become cumbersome and error-prone. C# collections like `List<T>`, `HashSet<T>`, and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` offer solutions tailored to these challenges. For instance, you can use `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` to map customer IDs to account details for quick lookups, `HashSet<T>` to ensure transaction uniqueness, and `List<T>` to maintain an ordered sequence of activities. These collections streamline data management, making your application robust and efficient.

In this module, you learn:

- Apply C# Collections for Efficient Data Management
- Manage ordered collections using `List<T>` in C#
- Manage unique collections with `HashSet<T>`
- Using `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` for efficient key-value pair management in C#

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Explain the purpose of strongly typed collections in C#.
- Implement and manipulate ordered sequences using the `List<T>` class.
- Utilize the `HashSet<T>` class to manage unique, unordered elements effectively.
- Apply the `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` class for fast key-based lookups and data mapping.
- Choose the appropriate collection type based on specific application requirements.
