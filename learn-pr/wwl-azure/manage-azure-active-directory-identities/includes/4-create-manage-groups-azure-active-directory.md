Just as groups in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) simplify permissions management, Microsoft Entra groups streamline access management. When you enable directory synchronization, your on-premises AD DS groups can be synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID. While the group membership remains consistent between AD DS and Microsoft Entra ID, the individual members are mapped from on-premises user accounts to their corresponding Microsoft Entra accounts. If directory synchronization isn't in place, group management is exclusively cloud-based.

In Microsoft Entra ID, you can establish two primary types of groups:

 -  **Security**. A security group is designed to manage resource access. By assigning permissions to a security group, you can control access based on group membership. For instance, if you create a security group named **Sales**, you can grant this group access to a specific file share. Managing the **Sales** group membership then indirectly manages access to that file share. Contrary to some misconceptions, Microsoft Entra security groups aren't mail-enabled.
 
 - **Microsoft 365**. A Microsoft 365 group facilitates access management for Microsoft 365 services, including Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and Outlook. For example, if you establish a Microsoft 365 group named **Sales**, you can delegate permissions for this group to access a SharePoint site. Managing the group's membership then determines access to that site. By design, Microsoft 365 groups are mail-enabled, serving dual purposes as collaboration groups and email distribution lists.

To create a group in Azure, navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Groups** > **New group** on the Azure portal. Here, you can specify the group type, name, and description. You'll also choose whether it's a security group or a Microsoft 365 group. Remember, only Microsoft 365 groups are inherently mail-enabled.

#### Assign Membership

Membership for a cloud-based group can be **assigned** or **dynamic**. When you create a group with assigned membership, you need to add and remove group members manually. When you create a group with dynamic membership, members are based on a query of Microsoft Entra objects. For example, dynamic membership can be based on a user’s department. You can create a membership rule based on a single attribute or an advanced membership rule where you can create complex queries based on multiple attributes.

When you create a group with dynamic membership, you need to select whether it’s for users or devices. Many Microsoft 365 features can use user-based groups. Intune uses device-based groups.

Groups from on-premises AD DS with dynamic membership don’t synchronize with Microsoft Entra ID.
