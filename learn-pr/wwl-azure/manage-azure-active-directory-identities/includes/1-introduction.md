Similar to locally deployed AD DS, you manage Microsoft Entra objects and settings, but by using a different set of tools. When using Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need to create users, groups, and devices. Also, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure to configure and delegate permissions. Unlike AD DS, you can manage multiple Microsoft Entra tenants by using an account from a single tenant. In this lesson, you'll learn how to manage Microsoft Entra ID.

After this module, you should be able to:

 -  Describe RBAC and user roles in Microsoft Entra ID.
 -  Create and manage users in Microsoft Entra ID.
 -  Create and manage groups in Microsoft Entra ID.
 -  Use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to manage Microsoft Entra ID.
 -  Describe how you can synchronize objects from AD DS to Microsoft Entra ID.
