In this module you've learned how permissions are assigned in SharePoint Online. You've also learned how external sharing is configured to help ensure that sensitive information isn't shared when it shouldn't be. The following are the key takeaways:

- SharePoint Online is used to create sites for user collaboration and file storage in addition to being used as storage for other Microsoft 365 services. You can use the web-based SharePoint admin center to manage many SharePoint Online features. However, for certain advanced operations, you will need the SharePoint Online Management Shell, a Windows PowerShell module.
- To provide access to a SharePoint site, you can assign users and groups varying levels of site permissions. To assign permissions in SharePoint Online by using PowerShell, you create SharePoint groups. To give permissions to Microsoft Entra users, you must make them members of a SharePoint group.
- In SharePoint Online, you can have multiple sites that contain different content. There's a default site designed for collaboration that's created automatically when you create your tenant. There are also sites created automatically for each Microsoft 365 group or Microsoft Team and OneDrive users. Additionally, you can create your own SharePoint sites and customize them.
- Microsoft OneDrive storage is part of SharePoint Online, because of which there are similar settings for both. When you configure settings for external sharing, the OneDrive settings must be the same or more restrictive than the SharePoint Online settings.
