Azure Administrators work with Log Analytics in the Azure portal to run log queries on their data in Azure Monitor logs. Administrators can create Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to consolidate and analyze their data.

In this module, you identified the features and usage cases for Log Analytics in Azure Monitor. You created a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal. You reviewed how to use KQL to structure a Log Analytics query and review the results.

The main takeaways from this module are:
- Log Analytics in Azure Monitor allows you to edit and run log queries for data collected in Azure Monitor Logs.
- It supports the Kusto Query Language (KQL) and provides features for detailed analysis and problem-solving.
- Log Analytics helps assess update requirements, track changes, and identify access issues in your systems.
