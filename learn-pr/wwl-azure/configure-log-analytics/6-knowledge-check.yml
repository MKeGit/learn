    choices:
    - content: "`summarize` and `render`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `summarize` operator creates a table that aggregates your input table content. The `render` operator prepares a visualization of your query results, such as a pie chart, scatter graph, or time pivot."
    - content: "`aggregate` and `visualize`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can compose an aggregation function in KQL, and also create visualizations, but `aggregate` and `visualize` aren't recognized commands in KQL."
