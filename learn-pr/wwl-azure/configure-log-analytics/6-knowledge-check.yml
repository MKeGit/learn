  questions:
  - content: "How does Azure Monitor organize log data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Event queues"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure Monitor log data doesn't use event queues. Is there a more structured option?"
    - content: "Text files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Text files aren't an efficient way to organize log data."
    - content: "Tables"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Monitor log data organizes data by using tables."
  - content: "What KQL commands build an aggregation of input data and produce visuals for query results?"
    choices:
    - content: "`summarize` and `render`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `summarize` operator creates a table that aggregates your input table content. The `render` operator prepares a visualization of your query results, such as a pie chart, scatter graph, or time pivot."
    - content: "`aggregate` and `visualize`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can compose an aggregation function in KQL, and also create visualizations, but `aggregate` and `visualize` aren't recognized commands in KQL."
    - content: "`count` and `project`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `count` operator shows the number of records in an input record set. The `project` operator selects columns to include, drop, or insert."
