  questions:
  - content: "There are several Azure policies that need to be applied to a new branch office. What's the best approach?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a management group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure management groups provide a way for an organization to control and manage access, compliance, and policies for their subscription within their tenant."
    - content: "Create a policy initiative"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A policy initiative is a set of policy definitions that could be applied to the new branch office."
    - content: "Create a policy definition"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A policy definition expresses what to evaluate and what actions to take. Every policy definition has conditions under which it's enforced. The definition has an accompanying effect that takes place if the conditions are met. Policy definitions can be grouped into policy initiatives."
  - content: "To satisfy the finance team's request for billing by department, multiple resource groups have been created and the resource tags applied. What's the next step?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a management group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure management groups provide a way for an organization to control and manage access, compliance, and policies for their subscription within their tenant."
    - content: "Create an Azure policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An Azure policy requires that a resource tag is applied before the resource is created."
    - content: "Review the Azure Policy compliance page"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Azure Policy compliance page shows non-compliant initiatives, non-compliant policies, and non-compliant resources. Checking the page is useful after a policy is created and scoped."
  - content: "How can you ensure that only cost-effective virtual machine SKU sizes are deployed?"
    choices:
    - content: "Periodically inspect the deployment to see which SKU sizes are used"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this method could work, the process would be time consuming and prone to errors."
    - content: "Create an Azure RBAC role that defines the allowed virtual machine SKU sizes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure RBAC roles can be used to determine who can create virtual machines, but the roles don't necessarily reveal virtual machine SKU size."
    - content: "Create a policy in Azure Policy that specifies the allowed SKU sizes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. There's a built-in Azure policy to specify the allowed virtual machine SKU sizes. After the policy is enabled, it's applied whenever a virtual machine is created or resized."
  - content: "Which option can you use to manage governance across multiple Azure subscriptions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure initiatives"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An Azure initiative is a collection of Azure policy definitions, or rules that are grouped together to support a specific goal or purpose."
    - content: "Resource groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution."
    - content: "Management groups"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Management groups facilitate the hierarchical ordering of Azure resources into collections, at a level of scope above subscriptions. Distinct governance conditions can be applied to each management group, with Azure Policy and Azure role-based access controls, to manage Azure subscriptions effectively. The resources and subscriptions assigned to a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group."
