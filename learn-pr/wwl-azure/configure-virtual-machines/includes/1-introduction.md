Azure Virtual Machines enables you to create on-demand, scalable computing resources. Azure Architects commonly use virtual machines to gain greater control over the computing environment.

Your company is doing consumer research, and your team manages the on-premises servers. The servers you administer run the entire company infrastructure from web servers to databases. However, the hardware is aging and starting to struggle to keep up with some of the new data analysis applications being deployed. Rather than upgrade the hardware, the company has decided to deploy Azure virtual machines. You're responsible for deploying the new virtual machines. Your deployment tasks include correctly sizing the machines, selecting storage, and configuring networking.

In this module, you learn how to configure virtual machine names and locations. You examine virtual machine pricing models and discover how to determine the correct virtual machine size. You learn how to configure virtual machine storage, and how to create a virtual machine in the Azure portal. You select a secure virtual machine connection method, and how to configure Windows and Linux virtual machine connections.

The goal of this module is to learn how to configure and manage virtual machines in Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you learn how to:

- Determine the responsibilities of cloud service providers and customers in a cloud computing environment.
- Identify the key considerations and factors involved in planning for virtual machines. Considerations include workload requirements, resource allocation, and secure access.
- Configure virtual machine storage and virtual machine sizing.
- Create a virtual machine in the Azure portal.
- Practice deploying an Azure virtual machine and verify the configuration.
