Azure Administrators understand how to select and configure virtual machines. Azure Virtual Machines is one of several types of on-demand, scalable computing resources that Azure offers. Virtual machines are typically used when you need greater control over your computing environment.

In this module, you learned how to configure virtual machine names and locations. You examined virtual machine pricing models and discovered how to determine the correct virtual machine size. You discovered how to configure virtual machine storage, and how to create a virtual machine in the Azure portal. You reviewed how to select a secure virtual machine connection method, and how to configure Windows and Linux virtual machine connections.

The main takeaways from this module are:
- Azure Virtual Machines is a type of on-demand, scalable computing resource offered by Azure that provides greater control over your computing environment.
- When configuring virtual machines, it is important to consider factors such as network configuration, virtual machine name, location, size, storage, pricing options, and operating system.
- There are multiple ways to connect to your Azure virtual machines. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connects Windows-based virtual machines. Secure Shell (SSH) protocol connects to Linux-based virtual machines. Azure Bastion is a fully managed PaaS service that provides secure RDP/SSH connectivity to virtual machines directly over SSL.
