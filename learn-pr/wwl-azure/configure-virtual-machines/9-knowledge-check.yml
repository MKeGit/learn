  questions:
  - content: "Which virtual machine is best for running a network appliance?"
    choices:
    - content: "Memory-optimized virtual machine"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Memory-optimized virtual machines are better for large in-memory business critical workloads that require massive parallel compute power."
    - content: "Compute-optimized virtual machine"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Compute-optimized virtual machines are designed to have a high CPU-to-memory ratio. These virtual machines are suitable for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers."
    - content: "Storage-optimized virtual machine"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Storage-optimized virtual machines are better for data warehousing applications and large transactional databases."
  - content: "For the security requirements, how can you connect to Azure Linux virtual machines and install software?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure a guest configuration on the virtual machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The guest configuration isn't a valid solution. Is there a better answer?"
    - content: "Create a custom script extension."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Custom script extensions are for post-deployment configuration, software installation, or any other configuration or management task."
    - content: "Configure Azure Bastion."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure Bastion is a fully platform-managed PaaS service provisioned inside a virtual network. Azure Bastion provides secure and seamless RDP and SSH connectivity to virtual machines. The access uses the Azure portal and SSL."
  - content: "What effect do the default network security settings have on a new virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Outbound requests are allowed. Inbound traffic is allowed only from within the virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Outbound requests are considered low risk, so they're allowed by default. Inbound traffic from within the virtual network is allowed."
    - content: "No outbound and inbound requests are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Outbound requests are allowed by default."
    - content: "There are no restrictions. All outbound and inbound requests are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are restrictions on inbound traffic."
