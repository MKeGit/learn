Azure Administrators must be familiar with configuring user and group accounts in Microsoft Entra ID.

In this module, you learned that every user who wants access to Azure resources needs an Azure user account. Microsoft Entra ID supports access to your organization's resources by assigning access rights to users and groups. You discovered how user and group accounts are created in Microsoft Entra ID. You explored how to configure and manage user and group accounts, including bulk configuration. You reviewed how your organization can support group account organization, and manage accounts across multiple directories.

The main takeaways for this module are:

- Microsoft Entra ID supports three types of user accounts: cloud identities, directory-synchronized identities, and guest user identities.

- Cloud identities have profile information such as job title and office location. This information can be customized for your organization's needs.

- You can bulk create user and group accounts. The process uses a template file managed through the portal.

- There are two types of group accounts: Security and Microsoft 365. 

- Administrative units help you control administrator access to resources.
