In this module, you learned about the integration of Azure identity and security services with SAP RISE workloads, and the use of Azure monitoring services. The module discussed how single sign-on (SSO) is configured for various SAP environments running in ECS/RISE, similar to a natively run SAP system. It provided tutorials on Microsoft Entra ID-based SSO integration with SAP NetWeaver, SAP Fiori, and SAP HANA. The module also covered different SSO methods, their typical use cases, and implementation details. Furthermore, it explained SSO against Active Directory (AD) for ECS/RISE managed SAP environments, emphasizing that domain integration isn't necessary for SSO with AD/Kerberos.

By completing this module, you can: 
- Understand and configure single sign-on (SSO) for SAP environments running in ECS/RISE using Microsoft Entra ID. 
- Manage SAP user lifecycle and authorizations using Microsoft Entra ID Governance. 
- Utilize Microsoft's Security Copilot for responding to cyber threats and assessing risk exposure.
