Azure Pipelines provides a pre-defined agent pool-named **Azure Pipelines** with Microsoft-hosted agents.

It will often be an easy way to run jobs without configuring build infrastructure.

The following virtual machine images are provided by default:

 -  Windows Server 2022 with Visual Studio 2022.
 -  Windows Server 2019 with Visual Studio 2019.
 -  Ubuntu 20.04.
 -  Ubuntu 18.04.
 -  macOS 11 Big Sur.
 -  macOS X Catalina 10.15.

By default, all contributors in a project are members of the User role on each hosted pool.

It allows every contributor to author and run build and release pipelines using a Microsoft-hosted pool.

Pools are used to run jobs. Learn about [specifying pools for jobs](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases).
