Azure Container Registry is a managed registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. It's used to store and manage container images and related artifacts.

## Scenario

Imagine you work for a software development company that builds and deploys containerized applications. Your team is responsible for managing the container images and ensuring they're easily accessible to the development and deployment pipelines. However, you're facing challenges in storing and managing these images efficiently. You need a solution that provides a secure and scalable way to store and manage container images. This is where Azure Container Registry comes in. With Azure Container Registry, you can easily store and manage your container images in a private registry. It provides a reliable and scalable solution for your container image management needs, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying your applications.
