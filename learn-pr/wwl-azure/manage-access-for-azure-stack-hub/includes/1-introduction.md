Your choice of either Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is determined by the mode in which you deploy Azure Stack Hub. When you deploy in connected mode, you can use either Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). When you deploy in a disconnected mode (without a connection to the internet), only Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is allowed.
