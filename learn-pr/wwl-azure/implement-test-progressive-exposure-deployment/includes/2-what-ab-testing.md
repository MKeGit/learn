A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) compares two versions of a web page or app against each other to determine which one does better.

A/B testing is mainly an experiment where two or more page variants are shown to users at random.

Also, statistical analysis is used to determine which variation works better for a given conversion goal.

A/B testing isn't part of continuous delivery or a pre-requisite for continuous delivery. It's more the other way around.

Continuous delivery allows you to deliver MVPs to a production environment and your end-users quickly.

Common aims are to experiment with new features, often to see if they improve conversion rates.

Experiments are continuous, and the impact of change is measured.

A/B testing is out of scope for this course.

But because it's a powerful concept that is enabled by implementing continuous delivery, it's mentioned here to dive into further.
