## Explore shared goals

These outcomes should include specific, measurable targets like:

 -  Reduce the time spent on fixing bugs by 60%.
 -  Reduce the time spent on unplanned work by 70%.
 -  Reduce the out-of-hours work required by staff to no more than 10% of total working time.
 -  Remove all direct patching of production systems.

> [!NOTE]
> One of the aims of DevOps is to provide more excellent customer value, so outcomes should have a customer value focus.

## Define timelines for goals

Measurable goals also need to have timelines. While it is easy to set longer-term goals, it is also easy to put off work when you do not require it for a while.

It is essential to have an ongoing series of short-term goals. Overall, projects should have timelines that span anywhere from a few months to a year or two in any DevOps transformation project.

Every few weeks, the improvements should be clear and measurable. Ideally, evident to the organization or its customers.

The timeline should not be too short and should always be challenging yet achievable. A review should occur after each short-term goal to help plan the next one.

There are several advantages of the shorter timelines:

 -  It is easier to change plans or priorities when necessary.
 -  The reduced delay between doing work and getting feedback helps ensure that the learnings and feedback are incorporated quickly.
 -  It is easier to keep organizational support when positive outcomes are clear.
