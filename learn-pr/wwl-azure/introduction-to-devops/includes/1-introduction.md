**"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users."** \- According to Donovan Brown in [What is DevOps?](https://www.donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops)

The DevOps learning paths will help you prepare for a DevOps journey. You'll learn the main characteristics of the DevOps process, tools, and people involved during the lifecycle. Also, it prepares you for the Microsoft DevOps Solution certification exam. You'll see other content to ensure you have a complete picture of DevOps. The module's content includes graphics, reference links, module review questions, and optional hands-on labs.

You'll learn the following:

 -  How to plan for DevOps.
 -  Use source control.
 -  Scale Git for an enterprise.
 -  Combine artifacts.
 -  Design a dependency management strategy.
 -  Manage secrets.
 -  Implement continuous integration.
 -  Implement a container-build strategy.
 -  Design a release strategy.
 -  Set up a release management workflow.
 -  Implement a deployment pattern.
 -  Optimize feedback mechanisms.

Plan before you act. This module will help you understand what DevOps is and how to plan for a DevOps transformation journey.

## What is the DevOps transformation journey?

The DevOps transformation journey is a series of 8 learning paths. It familiarizes you with Azure DevOps and GitHub. Also, learn its many services, features, and integration with tools to support your DevOps process.

### Why should I take the DevOps learning path?

People in these modules are interested in designing and implementing DevOps processes. Also, they're preparing for the [AZ-400 - Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions](/learn/certifications/exams/az-400) certification exam.

The certification exam is for DevOps professionals. Combine people, processes, and technologies to continuously deliver valuable products and services that meet end-user needs and business goals. DevOps professionals streamline delivery by optimizing practices, improving communications and collaboration, and creating automation.

They design and implement application code and infrastructure strategies that allow continuous integration, testing, delivery, monitoring, and feedback.

Exam candidates must be proficient with Agile practices. They must be familiar with Azure administration, development and experts in at least one of these areas.

DevOps professionals must design and implement DevOps practices for version control, compliance, infrastructure as code, configuration management, build, release, and testing-using Azure technologies.

There are five domain areas.

| **AZ-400 Domain Area**                             | **Weight** |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Design and implement processes and communications. | 11%        |
| Design and implement a source control strategy.    | 13%        |
| Design and implement build and release pipelines.  | 51%        |
| Develop a security and compliance plan.            | 16%        |
| Implement an instrumentation strategy.             | 9%         |

## Learning objectives

After completing this series, students and professionals can:

 -  Design and implement traceability and flow of work.
 -  Design and implement appropriate metrics and queries for DevOps.
 -  Configure collaboration and communication.
 -  Design and implement branching strategies for the source code.
 -  Configure and manage repositories.
 -  Design and implement a package management strategy.
 -  Design and implement a testing strategy for pipelines.
 -  Design and implement pipelines.
 -  Design and implement deployments.
 -  Design and implement infrastructure as code (IaC).
 -  Maintain pipelines.
 -  Design and implement authentication and authorization methods.
 -  Design and implement a strategy for managing sensitive information in automation.
 -  Automate security and compliance scanning.
 -  Configure monitoring for a DevOps environment.
 -  Analyze metrics from instrumentation.

## Prerequisites

Successful learners will have prior knowledge and understanding of the following:

 -  Cloud computing concepts include understanding PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS implementations.
 -  Azure administration and Azure development with proven expertise in at least one of these areas.
 -  Foundational DevOps concepts, including version control, Agile software development, and core software development principles. It would be helpful to have experience in an organization that delivers software.
