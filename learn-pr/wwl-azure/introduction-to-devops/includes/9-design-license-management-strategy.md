When designing a license management strategy, you first need to understand your progress in the DevOps implementation phase.

If you have a draft of the architecture, you're planning for the DevOps implementation; you already know part of the resources to consume.

For example, you started with a version control-implementing Git and created some pipelines to build and release your code.

If you have multiple teams building their solutions, you don't want to wait in the queue to start building yours.

Probably, you want to pay for parallel jobs and make your builds run in parallel without depending on the queue availability.

**To consider:**

 -  What phase are you in?
 -  How many people are using the feature?
 -  How long are you willing to wait if in the queue for pipelines? Is this urgent? Is this a validation only?
 -  Should all users access all features? Are they Stakeholders? Basic users? Do they already have a Visual Studio license?
 -  Do you have an advanced Package Management strategy? Maybe you need more space for Artifacts.
