The remainder of this module walks you through the process of using the Azure REST API to trigger an assessment and an update deployment on your Azure Arc-enabled servers with Azure Update Manager in Azure.

If you're new to Azure Update Manager and you want to learn more, see [overview of Update Manager](/azure/update-manager/overview).

Update Manager in Azure enables you to use the appropriate REST commands from [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure) and [Azure CLI](/cli/azure).

Support for Azure REST API to manage Azure Arc-enabled servers is available through the Update Manager virtual machine extension.

## Update assessment

To trigger an update assessment on your Azure Arc-enabled server, specify the following POST request. To specify the POST request, you can use the Azure CLI az rest command.

```azurecli
az rest --method post --url
<INSERT URL>
```

The format of the request body for version 2020-08-15 is as follows:

```azurecli
{
}
```

## Update deployment

To trigger an update deployment to your Azure Arc-enabled server, specify the following POST request:

<!--- raw content start --->
POST on `subscriptions/subscriptionId/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/machineName/installPatches?api-version=2020-08-15-preview`
<!--- raw content end --->
