Update Manager is a unified service to help manage and govern updates for all your machines. You can monitor Windows and Linux update compliance across your deployments in Azure, on-premises, and on other cloud platforms from a single dashboard. You can also use Update Manager to make real-time updates or schedule them within a defined maintenance window.

You can use Update Manager in Azure to:

 -  Oversee update compliance for your entire fleet of machines in Azure, on-premises, and in other cloud environments.
 -  Instantly deploy critical updates to help secure your machines.
 -  Use flexible patching options such as [automatic virtual machine (VM) guest patching](/azure/virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching) in Azure, [hotpatching](/azure/automanage/automanage-hotpatch), and customer-defined maintenance schedules.

There are more capabilities to help you manage updates for your Azure VMs that you should consider as part of your overall update management strategy. To learn more about the options that are available, see the Azure VM [update options](/azure/virtual-machines/updates-maintenance-overview).
