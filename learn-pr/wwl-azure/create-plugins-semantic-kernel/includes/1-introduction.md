When using the Semantic Kernel SDK, plugins act as the building blocks of your artificially intelligent (AI) application. Plugins define the tasks the kernel should complete. The kernel interfaces with a large language model (LLM) and runs the plugins you provide. Your plugins can include native code and natural language prompts, allowing you to use generative AI to perform a wide variety of tasks in your applications.

Suppose you're a developer for Margie's Travel, a global leader in the travel and hospitality industry. You're tasked to create a personalized AI travel agent. You can create customized plugins that can allow your agent to provide destination recommendations, book accommodations, perform currency conversions, and even helpful phrases in a language of their choice. 

In this module, you learn how to create your own plugins with the Semantic Kernel SDK. You also learn how to use built-in plugins provided by the Semantic Kernel package to create intelligent applications.
