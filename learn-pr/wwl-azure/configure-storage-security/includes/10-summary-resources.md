Azure Administrators must be familiar with how to configure storage security.

In this module, you examined several options for securing Azure Storage. You discovered how to configure shared access signatures (SAS), including the uniform resource identifier (URI) and SAS parameters. You reviewed how to implement customer-managed keys and define stored access policies to configure Azure Storage encryption. You explored opportunities for improving your Azure Storage security solution.
