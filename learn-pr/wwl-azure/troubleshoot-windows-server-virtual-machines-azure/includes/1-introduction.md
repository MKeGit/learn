As with on-premises physical servers, you occasionally encounter problems with your Azure-hosted Windows Server virtual machines (VMs). In some respects, the approach you take to troubleshoot Azure-hosted VMs is similar to the approach you take in an on-premises context. However, in other respects, there are some crucial differences. For example, if a hosted VM doesn’t start up, you don’t have the same physical access to the device as in your on-premises datacenter. In addition, if you’re connecting to a hosted VM, there are often other security considerations, such as just-in-time access and Azure Bastion; these features help secure access to your VMs, but if configured incorrectly, can make access difficult or impossible.

In this module, you learn to troubleshoot Azure-hosted Windows Server VM startup, connectivity, extensions, and performance. You also learn how to troubleshoot storage and encryption. Specifically, you:
- Learn how to troubleshoot Windows Server VM deployment in Azure.

- Learn how to troubleshoot VM startup, storage, encryption, and performance issues.

- Learn how to troubleshoot connectivity to Windows Server VMs in Azure.

## Learning objectives
