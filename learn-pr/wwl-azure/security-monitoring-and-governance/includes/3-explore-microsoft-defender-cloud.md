**Microsoft Defender for Cloud** is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all your services both in Azure and on-premises. Microsoft Defender can:

 -  Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks.
 -  Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads and automatically apply required security to new services as they come online.
 -  Continuously monitor all your services and do automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
 -  Use Azure Machine Learning to detect and block malicious software from being installed on your virtual machines (VMs) and services. You can also define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only the validated apps can execute.
 -  Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks and help investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
 -  Provide just-in-time (JIT) access control for ports by reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic that you require.
