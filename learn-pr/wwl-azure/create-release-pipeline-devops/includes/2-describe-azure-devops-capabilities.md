Azure DevOps has extended support for pipelines as code (also called YAML pipelines) for continuous deployment and started introducing various release management capabilities into pipelines as code.

The existing UI-based release management solution in Azure DevOps is referred to as classic release.

You'll find a list of capabilities and availability in YAML pipelines vs. classic build and release pipelines in the following table.
