Azure CLI lets you control nearly every aspect of every Azure resource.

You can work with Azure resources such as resource groups, storage, VMs, Azure Active Directory, containers, and machine learning.

Commands in the CLI are structured in ***groups*** and ***subgroups***.

Each group represents a service provided by Azure, and the subgroups divide commands for these services into logical groupings.

So, how do you find the commands you need? One way is to use the **az find** command.

For example, if you want to find commands that might help you manage a storage blob, you can use the following **find** command:

```azurecli
az find blob

```

If you know the command's name you want, the help argument for that command will get you more detailed information on the commandâ€”also, a list of the available subcommands for a command group.

For example, here's how you would get a list of the subgroups and commands for managing blob storage:

```azurecli
az storage blob --help

```

## Creating resources

When creating a new Azure resource, typically, there are three high-level steps:

1.  Connect to your Azure subscription.
2.  Create the resource.
3.  Verify that creation was successful.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/create-resources-overview-697de4ba.png" alt-text="An illustration has the three steps to create an Azure resource using the command-line interface.":::


### 1. Connect

Because you're working with a local Azure CLI installation, you'll need to authenticate before you can execute Azure commands.

You do it by using the Azure CLI **login** command:

```azurecli
az login

```

Azure CLI will typically launch your default browser to open the Azure sign in page.

If it doesn't work, follow the command-line instructions, and enter an authorization code in the [Enter Code](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) dialog box.

After a successful sign in, you'll be connected to your Azure subscription.

### 2. Create

You'll often need to create a new resource group before you create a new Azure service.

So we'll use resource groups as an example to show how to create Azure resources from the Azure CLI.

The Azure CLI **group create** command creates a resource group.

You need to specify a name and location.

The *name* parameter must be unique within your subscription.

The *location* parameter determines where the metadata for your resource group will be stored.

You use strings like "West US," "North Europe," or "West India" to specify the location.

Instead, you can use single-word equivalents, such as "westus," "northeurope," or "westindia."

The core syntax to create a resource group is:

```azurecli
az group create --name <name> --location <location>

```

### 3. Verify installation

For many Azure resources, Azure CLI provides a **list** subcommand to get resource details.

For example, the Azure CLI **group list** command lists your Azure resource groups.

It's helpful to verify whether resource group creation was successful:

```azurecli
az group list

```

To get more concise information, you can format the output as a simple table:

```azurecli
az group list --output table

```

If you have several items in the group list, you can filter the return values by adding a **query** option using, for example, the following command:

```azurecli
az group list --query "[?name == '<rg name>']"

```

> [!NOTE]
> You format the query using **JMESPath**, which is a standard query language for JSON requests.

You can learn more about this filter language at [http://jmespath.org/](http://jmespath.org/).

## Using Azure CLI in scripts

To use Azure CLI commands in scripts, you'll need to be aware of any issues around the shell or environment you use to run the script.

For example, in a bash shell, you can use the following syntax when setting variables:

```azurecli
variable="value"
variable=integer

```

If you use a PowerShell environment for running Azure CLI scripts, you'll need to use the following syntax for variables:

```powershell
$variable="value"
$variable=integer

```
