Just about every task you can complete in the Azure portal, you can complete using Azure CLI reference commands. Using the Azure portal to learn about Azure is a great place to begin. However, we recommend using the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to manage Azure resources at scale.

Consider the scenario where you manage Azure for a world-wide corporation.  You receive multiple requests daily for new resource groups, Azure logic apps, storage accounts, data factories and Azure SQL databases. All of your teams work in development, stage and production environments so for every request, you need to create three similar Azure resources that follow your corporations naming standards and security policies.

It's time to use Azure CLI!


Complex or repetitive tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone when performed manually.
Organizations prefer to automate these tasks to reduce costs and avoid mistakes.

Automation is essential in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) example where you're testing
your software on multiple virtual machines. These machines might need to be continuously deleted and
re-created. Using an Azure CLI script to automate VM creation is much more efficient and reliable
than manually creating them each time.
