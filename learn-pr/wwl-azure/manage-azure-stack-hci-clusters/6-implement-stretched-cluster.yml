quiz:
  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You are designing a disaster recovery site for Contoso that will provide disaster recovery capabilities for Azure Stack HCI clusters in the primary site. You need to ensure that you will be able to implement a stretched cluster to automate failover of the virtualized workloads. What should be the maximum round-trip network latency between the two sites?"
    choices:
    - content: "< 5 ms"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The synchronous replication requirement imposes a limit of 5 ms round-trip network latency between two groups of cluster nodes in the replicated sites."
    - content: "< 50 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This latency would be acceptable only with asynchronous replication, which is not supported by Azure Stack HCI stretched clusters."
    - content: "< 200 ms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This latency would be acceptable only with asynchronous replication, which is not supported by Azure Stack HCI stretched clusters."
