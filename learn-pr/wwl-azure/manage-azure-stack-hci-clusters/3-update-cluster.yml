  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "To evaluate the functionality of Azure Stack HCI for Contoso, you decide to test the implementation of CAU by using Windows Admin Center. What do you have to do before you can proceed with the implementation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create the CAU clustered role."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows Admin Center creates the CAU clustered role automatically. There is no need to create it first."
    - content: "Enable CredSSP."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To implement CAU by using Windows Admin Center, you have to enable CredSSP and provide administrative credentials that will be used to connect to cluster nodes."
    - content: "Take the cluster virtual disks offline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is required if you want to perform an offline update of all cluster nodes at the same time, rather than CAU-based deployment."
