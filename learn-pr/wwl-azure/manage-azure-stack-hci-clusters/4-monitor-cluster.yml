  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "As part of evaluating the functionality of Azure Stack HCI for Contoso, you decide to implement alerting in response to the performance or stability issues affecting your clustered workloads. Which technology should you choose to provide the alerting functionality? Your solution must minimize the administrative effort."
    choices:
    - content: "Windows Admin Center"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Windows Admin Center considerably simplifies the monitoring tasks, but it does not offer built-in alerting support."
    - content: "PowerShell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it is possible to implement alerting by using custom PowerShell scripts, this would require more administrative effort than using Azure Monitor."
    - content: "Azure Monitor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. In-depth monitoring, alerting, and log analytics are available by integrating Azure Stack HCI with Azure Monitor."
