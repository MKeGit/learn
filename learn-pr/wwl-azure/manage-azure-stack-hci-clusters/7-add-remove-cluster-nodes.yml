  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "To evaluate the functionality of Azure Stack HCI for Contoso, you added a new server to an existing cluster, which is hosting many clustered VMs. You need to ensure that the cluster is eligible for Microsoft support. What should you do next from Windows Admin Center?"
    choices:
    - content: "Rerun cluster validation and verify that it completed successfully."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Successful cluster validation is a prerequisite for Microsoft support."
    - content: "Re-register the cluster with Azure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Perform re-registration with Azure after the cluster is provisioned. There is no need for re-registering the cluster after adding or removing cluster nodes."
    - content: "Join the server to the same AD DS domain that is joined by other cluster nodes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Complete this step before you add a server to an existing cluster."
