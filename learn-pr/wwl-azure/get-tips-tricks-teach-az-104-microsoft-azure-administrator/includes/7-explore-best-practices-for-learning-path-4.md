As you're preparing to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path – the concepts and methodologies they are working through. In this learning path, students learn about virtual networks and subnets, including IP addressing. Students also explore network security groups, implementing network security group rules, and evaluating network security group effective rules. Additionally, students determine when to implement Azure Firewall.  

This learning path consists of three lessons: 

**Lesson 1** – Configure Virtual Networks

**Lesson 2** – Configure Network Security Groups 

**Lesson 3** – Configure Azure Domain Name Service (DNS)

### Learning Path 4 Tips and Tricks 

- This is a great opportunity to whiteboard concept virtual networks while engaging learners in networking discussions
- Provide links if they need further understanding of subnetting rather than teaching how to subnet 
- Explain that NSGs is not a substitute for firewalls by quickly explaining defense in depth
