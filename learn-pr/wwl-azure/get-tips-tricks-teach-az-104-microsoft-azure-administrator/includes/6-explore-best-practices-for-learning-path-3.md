AZ-104: Learning path 3 Administer Azure Resources

As you're preparing to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path – the concepts and methodologies they are working through. In this learning path, students begin to understand the different tools and techniques that they can use to administer Azure. Students learn about the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and explore Azure Administrator tools including Azure portal, Azure Cloud Shell, Azure PowerShell, and Azure Command Line Interface (CLI). Additionally, students understand the operations of ARM templates and how they relate to the resources in Microsoft Azure.   

This learning path consists of two lessons: 

- **Lesson 1** – Configure Azure Resources with Tools 

- **Lesson 2** – Configure Resources with ARM Templates
