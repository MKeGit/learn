AZ-104: Learning Path 5 Administer Intersite Connectivity 

As you're preparing to teach this learning path, get familiar with what the students learn during the learning path. In this learning path, students learn about Intersite Connectivity. Students identify use cases and product features of virtual network peering as well as configure gateway transit, connectivity, and service chaining. Students explore how to create and configure Azure Virtual Private Network (VPN) Gateway and new concepts like Azure ExpressRoute.  

This learning path consists of two lessons: 

- **Lesson 1** – Configure Virtual Networks (VNet) Peering 

- **Lesson 2** – Configure Network Routing and Endpoints

### Learning Path 5 Tips and Tricks 

- This is a great opportunity to whiteboard the concepts of VNet Peering and Routing. It’s suggested to take the diagrams from Learning Path 4 and build on them.
- Rember that VPN has been removed from the course, but you still need to discuss it for learners to understand Gateway transit. (Courses AZ-700 or AZ-305 provide learning about VPN gateways and Express Route)
- Explain the difference between Service Endpoints and Private Link. This can be confusing to learners. It’s recommended to Whiteboard this concept
- End of Learning Path Review Activity slide can be helpful for understanding the concepts
