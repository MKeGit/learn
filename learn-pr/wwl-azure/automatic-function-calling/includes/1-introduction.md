The Semantic Kernel SDK allows developers to integrate results from large language models (LLMs) with semantic prompts and native function plugins. While you can manually invoke functions and prompts, the SDK also supports automatic function calling. Automatic function calling can coordinate which plugins and functions to invoke based on the user's request. This feature can help you build adaptive applications that respond intelligently to dynamic user input.

Suppose you want to create an AI music service can provides a personalized listening experience. You can create the plugins to interact with a music library, add songs to a user's "Recently Played" list, and recommend songs and concerts. Using auto function calling, you can allow the appropriate plugins to be automatically selected depending on user input. This feature can help provide dynamic functionality, allowing your AI agent to adapt to different scenarios without explicit programming.

In this module, you learn about the different ways you can automatically invoke functions using the Semantic Kernel SDK.
