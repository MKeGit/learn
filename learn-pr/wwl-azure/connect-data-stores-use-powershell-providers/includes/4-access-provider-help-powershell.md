You can display a list of available providers by using the **Get-PSProvider** cmdlet. Be aware that providers can be added into Windows PowerShell when you load modules, and they don't display until loaded. For example, when you run the **Import-Module ActiveDirectory** command to load the **ActiveDirectory** module or use module autoloading when running an Active Directory cmdlet, a PowerShell provider for Active Directory is included.

Some providers include help files that you can review. Help files use the naming format **about_ProviderName_Provider**. For example, the help file for the FileSystem provider is **about_FileSystem_Provider**. You can review this help file's contents by running the following command:

```powershell
Get-Help about_FileSystem_Provider
```

Cmdlets that work with providers use the nouns **Item** and **ItemProperty**. To list cmdlets that work with providers, run the following cmdlets:

```powershell
Get-Command *-Item,*-ItemProperty
```

Examples for every scenario might not be in commandsâ€™ help, because the commands are designed to work with any provider. The intent of provider help is to supplement command help with more specific descriptions and examples.
