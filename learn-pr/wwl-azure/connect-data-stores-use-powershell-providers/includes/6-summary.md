In this module, you learned about PowerShell providers, their capabilities, and how to access PowerShell provider help files. The following are the key takeaways:
- A PowerShell provider, or just provider, is an adapter that makes some data stores resemble hard drives within Windows PowerShell. They offer an easier-to-understand and consistent interface for working with data stores. 
- The advantage of a PowerShell provider is that it's dynamic, which makes it suitable for technologies that are subject to frequent changes. 
- Some common providers include Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, and Variable.
- The Get-PSProvider cmdlet lists the capabilities of each provider that loads into Windows PowerShell. 
- Some providers include help files that you can review. Help files use the naming format about_ProviderName_Provider.
