With the wide range of data stores available in Azure, there's the need to manage and orchestrate the movement data between them. In fact, you'll usually want to automate *extract, transform, and load* (ETL) workloads as a regular process in a wider enterprise analytical solution. *Pipelines* are a mechanism for defining and orchestrating data movement activities. In this module, you'll be introduced to Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines, their component parts, and how to implement and run a pipeline in Azure Synapse Studio.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines are built on the same technology as Azure Data Factory, and offer a similar authoring experience. The authoring processes described in this module are also applicable to Azure Data Factory. For a detailed discussion of the differences between Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines and Azure Data Factory, see [Data integration in Azure Synapse Analytics versus Azure Data Factory](/azure/synapse-analytics/data-integration/concepts-data-factory-differences?azure-portal=true).
