Organizational knowledge builds up within development teams over time.

It's essential to avoid endlessly relearning the same lessons that the team (and the organization) has learned before.

As staff turnover occurs in teams, it's easy for organizational knowledge to be lost. It's important to record this knowledge to avoid this loss.

A simple example is if the team has developed coding standards. It should be captured and not just exist as word of mouth.

Relearning old lessons is both wasteful and expensive.

## To reflect

Azure DevOps can be used with a wide range of existing tooling used to share knowledge.

 -  Which knowledge-sharing tools do you currently use (if any)?
 -  What do you or don't you like about the tools?
