        DISA is the Defense Information Systems Agency. It provides "enterprise" information technology capabilities for the multiple branches and components of the Department of Defense. It has also been tasked with the implementation of the Department of Defense CIO's cloud strategy.

        DISA provides information technology (IT) and communications support to the President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense, military services, combatant commands, and any individual or system contributing to the defense of the United States. It does so "at Enterprise scale."

        DISA standardizes the offerings across branches, which can involve a lot of coordination and planning. While every Defense component may need the same services, DISA ensures that they are deployed in a consistent manner, and also helps to save on costs.

## Staff

### Offices

DISA includes five high-level offices:

- Joint Service Provider

### Centers

DISA includes four core centers:

- Digital Capabilities and Security Center
- Hosting and Compute Center
- Enterprise Operations and Infrastructure Center

### Administrative control (ADCON)

Because it provides IT and communications support to the executive branch, DISA includes four administrative control organizations:

- Joint Artificial Intelligence Center

- White House Situation Support Staff

### Combatant command field offices

DISA also operates a number of combatant command field offices globally including:

- DISA AFRICA

### MilCloud

milCloud was a cloud-service portfolio of cloud offerings targeted toward "driving further agility, development, deployment, and maintenance of Department of Defense applications." milCloud was operated on the DISA DODIN network. milCloud leveraged commercial off the shelf (COTS) software as well as government off the shelf (GOTS) software to provide cloud capabilities targeted to needs of the Department of Defense.

milCloud was one of several offerings available to DoD consumers to meet DOD-specific cloud computing needs. These offerings included multiple cloud computing environments, such as Microsoft's U.S. sovereign clouds.

As of May 2022, DISA discontinued milCloud as an offering.

## Impact on cloud strategy

### Cloud strategy implementor

As of 2021, DISA was designated the official implementation arm for the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer's cloud implementation strategy. As such, DISA provides significant influence as to how the Department of Defense leverages cloud computing technology.

### Contracting and procurement

DISA provides a number of contract vehicles by which services may be provided to the Department of Defense and through which the DoD may procure products or service to be made available to all divisions of the DoD. As such, DISA has significant influence on how the DoD contracts for and procures cloud computing technology and services. 

### Enterprise services

Enterprise services are those that are mission-enabling, shared services provided to all groups as a centrally funded model. Because DISA provides services at enterprise scale, such services may be considered utility rather than specialized. As such, DISA's offerings must address a wide range of use case scenarios, and provide a broad set of services.
