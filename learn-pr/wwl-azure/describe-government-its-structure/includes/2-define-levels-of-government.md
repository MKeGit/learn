While many people automatically associate U.S. sovereign cloud offerings with the U.S. federal government, federal, state, local, and tribal governments may use these offerings.

Within the United States, there are several levels of Government.

## The federal government

The National Government is also known as the United States Government (USG) or the federal government. The federal government provides for national/regional defense, conducts foreign affairs, and addresses issues that are national/regional or global in scope. These issues cannot be addressed at only a state or local level, such as air pollution, climate, or interstate commerce.

These responsibilities of the National Government are defined in the United States Constitution. For those duties not defined in the U.S. Constitution, those responsibilities are assigned to the states.

The National Government is divided into three branches: the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.

The Executive Branch has offices across the country/region as well as around the globe because of its charter. It's led by the President.

The Legislative Branch consists of Congress: the House of Representatives and the Senate, chartered with making laws and controlling government spending.

The Judicial branch consists of the Federal Court system, with courts across the country/region, but headquartered in Washington D.C.

Each branch leverages U.S. sovereign clouds for their specific purposes.

## State governments

The United States is divided into 50 states, several territories, commonwealths, and the District of Columbia.

States are responsible for their own self-rule. States have their own executive, legislative, and judicial branches as well that operate within their geographic boundaries.

Multiple states or territories coordinate efforts through organizations such as the [National Governors Association](https://www.nga.org/) or [The National Conference of State Legislators](https://www.ncsl.org/).

While states are autonomous, territories are operated at the Federal level. States and their branches leverage U.S. sovereign clouds for their specific purposes.

## Local governments

Each state is divided into counties, municipalities, parishes, or other geographic boundaries. They provide services such as police, firefighting, schools, libraries, recreational capabilities, and public works, such as local roads and waste treatment.

Within some counties are municipalities that sometimes provide these services instead of the county because of a greater density of population.

Counties coordinate efforts not at the state level through organizations like [The National Association of Counties](https://www.naco.org/) or [The National League of Cities](https://www.nlc.org/).

Local governments, such as counties or municipalities, also may leverage U.S. sovereign clouds for their specific purposes.

## Tribal governments

Within the United States, there are over 571 independent nations that are tribal governments recognized by the United States.

Tribal governments interact with the national Government, and are considered sovereign nations with their own legal jurisdiction over their own land. Each tribal nation has its own constitution that defines its structure. The structure typically consists of executive, legal, and judicial branches as well.

Tribal governments leverage U.S. sovereign clouds for their specific governing purposes.
