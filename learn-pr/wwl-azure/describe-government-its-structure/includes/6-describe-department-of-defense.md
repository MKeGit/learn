        The United States Department of Defense ("DOD") is a cabinet-level agency that coordinates and supervises all functions of the government directly related to America's security and the United States Armed Forces.

## Staff

The United States Department of Defense is the largest employer in the world, with over 1.3 million active-duty service members as of 2020. Active-duty members include soldiers, Marines, sailors, airmen, and National Guard members.

## Structure

The DOD includes three major branches:

- Army
- Navy
- Air Force

The DOD includes four government intelligence services:

- The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
- The National Security Agency (NSA)
- The National Geospatial Agency (NGA)
- The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)

The DOD also includes nine non-intelligence services that cross over different branches:

- Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA)
- Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO)
- Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
- Missile Defense Agency (MDA)
- Defense Health Agency (DHA)
- Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)
- Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA)
- Defense Contracts Management Agency (DCMA)
- The Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA)

## Impact on cloud strategy

Because of its size, its structure, its global reach, and the nature of the data that it handles, the DOD has a large influence on the US Governmentâ€™s cloud strategy.

### Security

Defending the United States isn't limited to only the physical battlefield. Modern war fighting includes the digital world, and protection of data and critical infrastructure to ensure the security of the nation and mission success. Because of the shifting role of digital warfare, the DoD sees the cloud as a "fundamental component of the global infrastructure that will empower the war fighter with data and is critical to maintaining our military's technological advantage."

### Technological advantage

Technology doesn't determine warfare. In many cases, though, it can change how warfare is conducted, or be in a position of authority--not simply the means to determine the outcome. Cloud computing capabilities provide leading-edge technological advances at hyper scale. As a result, the DoD has a vested interest in providing guidance and selection criteria as to the strategic and technical capabilities cloud computing providers should offer to best support technological superiority over adversaries, and do so in a secure and compliant manner.

### Recognition and usage of data and intelligence as an instrument for security

Data and the intelligence that may be assessed from it support both a strong security position, as well as empower the DoD to provide for "the common defense." Both intelligence and non-intelligence services that are part of the DoD have compelling interest in leveraging commercially proven technologies within their mission space to ensure data and intelligence security.

### Purchasing power

Because of its size, the DoD also provides the means to achieve the economies of scale cloud computing provides. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) have made substantial up-front capital investments in data centers. The DoD meets such a wide range of strategic and tactical objectives. As a result, the DoD has the ability to uniquely achieve greater value for taxpayers.

The DoD plays a pivotal role in determining where the US Government should expend its money in cloud computing technology to support America's security.
