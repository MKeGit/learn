        The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in response to the 9/11 attacks. This action represented the most sweeping re-organization of the US Government since 1947.
        
        Various pre-existing agencies had been spread amongst other Cabinet-level Agencies. DHS was first created as an Office, and then made into an official Cabinet-level Agency in 2003.
        
        The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for public security. Its stated missions involve anti-terrorism, border security, immigration and customs, cyber security, and disaster prevention and management.

## Impact on cloud strategy

### Cybersecurity

As it relates to the US Governmentâ€™s cloud strategy, DHS includes the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD). NCSD is responsible for the response system, risk management program, and U.S. cybersecurity requirements.

NCSD includes US-CERT operations and the National Cyber Alert System. US-CERT is the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team. US-CERT is responsible for analyzing and reducing cyber threats, vulnerabilities, disseminating cyber threat warning information, and coordinating incident response activities.

The DHS Science and Technology Directorate help government and private end-users transition to new cyber-security capabilities. The DHS Science and Technology Directorate also funds the Cyber Security Research and Development Center, which identifies and prioritizes research and development for NCSD.

CISA, or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, "leads the national effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our cyber and physical infrastructure." CISA plays a critical role in defining the US Government's approach toward security in cloud computing because it focuses on resiliency and cybersecurity.

### Trusted Internet Connection data

CISA operates the Trusted Internet Connection initiative. As part of this initiative, data that traverses government networks to or from cloud service providers must traverse a Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) device. The TIC devices must send that data to CISA and DHS for monitoring and operational awareness.

As a result, CISA and DHS have significant influence in providing input toward data integrity, security, and compliance when determining the government's cloud computing strategy.
