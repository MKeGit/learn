> While the requirement to conduct a business case analysis varies by agency or organization, the process of doing so will help to ensure that your efforts to use cloud computing, especially US Sovereign clouds, will ensure success.

        In 2011, the DoD published the Product Support business case analysis (BCA) Guidebook. In it, the DoD defined the purpose of a BCA as
    
        > “...a structured methodology and document that aids decision making by identifying and comparing alternatives by examining the mission and business impacts (both financial and non-financial), risks, and sensitivities… The Product Support BCA concludes with a recommendation and associated specific actions and an implementation plan to achieve stated organizational objectives and desired outcomes.”
    
        > "A BCA does not replace the judgment of a decision maker. Rather, it provides an analytic, standardized, and objective foundation upon which credible decisions can be made. A Product Support BCA should be a comprehensive, fair, and accurate comparison when evaluating multiple alternatives."

### Business case analysis purposes

A business case analysis has three primary purposes:

- Ensure a consistent approach to IT investment analysis
- Facilitate comparison of alternatives
- Clearly define expected costs, benefit, operational impacts, and risks

### Business case analysis components

The major components of a business case analysis are:

- Cost and economic viability
- Requirement satisfaction and completeness
- Operational benefits (qualitative)
- Risk assessment
- Conclusions and recommendations
- Balance of cost effectiveness and operational benefit
- Identification of funding type(s) and resources

## Standardized business case analysis template

In 2014, the DoD published the "DOD Use of Enterprise Information Technology Standard business case analysis" memorandum. This memo provides a template to ensure consistency. The costs, benefits, operational impacts, and risks are standardized when a cloud consumer chooses a solution.

### Business case analysis outline example

A business case analysis report (the output) typically follows the following format:

1. Executive Summary
1. Introduction
    1. Problem Statement
    1. Background
    1. Scope
1. Desired Outcomes and Requirements
    1. Desired Outcomes
    1. Requirements
1. Assumptions and Methods
    1. Ground Rules and Assumptions
    1. Analysis Methods, Tools, and Rationale
    1. Evaluation Criteria
1. Alternatives
    1. Current Baseline / Anticipated Initial Support / Status Quo
    1. Alternatives
1. Mission and Business Impacts
    1. Benefits and Non-Financial Analysis
    1. Cost and Financial Analysis
1. Risk Analysis and Mitigation Plans
    1. Risk Analysis
    1. Mitigation Plans
1. Sensitivity Analysis
1. Conclusion
    1. Comparison of Alternatives
    1. Summary of Results
1. Recommendations
    1. Specific Actions Based on Business Objectives
    1. Implementation Plan

## Process

The business case analysis process includes three major procedures

### 1. Prepare

Prepare includes the following steps:

- Gather requirements and desired outcomes
- Conduct any necessary due diligence
- Gather the business case analysis team members
- Conduct the business case analysis kickoff and validate the problem statement
- Design the governance structure and body
- Approve the draft problem statement, outcomes, and project plan

### 2. Conduct

Conduct includes the following steps:

- Draft alternatives, criteria, ground rules and assumptions, scope, methods, tools, and rationale
- Document authoritative data sources, and document the tools
- Draft the mission and business impact analysis
- Draft the risk and sensitivity analysis
- Draft the comparative analysis
- Draft the recommendation and implementation plan
- Draft an executive summary

### 3. Conclude

Conclude includes the following steps:

- Distribute the business case analysis for validation
- Adjudicate any edits
- Obtain final validation
- Obtain lessons learned, best practices, and resources identified
- Implement the business case analysis recommendations
- Satisfy the business case analysis requirements

## Importance

When choosing which cloud environment to leverage, a business case analysis may be necessary. Fortunately, Microsoft provides numerous tools to help support a business case analysis.

### Performance measures (baseline, target, and goal)

You can determine your baseline, target, and goal performance measures by using:
- [Azure service level agreements](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/)
- [Performance efficiency](/azure/architecture/framework/#performance-efficiency) in the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/)

### Operational impact

You can plan for operational impact by using the [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/):
- [Deliver operational excellence](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/operational-excellence)
- [Operating model alignment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/operating-model/)
- [Organizational alignment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/initial-org-alignment)
- [Reliability](/azure/architecture/framework/#reliability)
- [Security](/azure/architecture/framework/security/)
- [Operational Excellence](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/)

### Financial costs

You can project the savings projections the investment will guarantee by using
- [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)
- Total Cost of Ownership Calculator
- [Cost optimization](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/) in the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/)

Azure Commercial, Azure Government, Azure Secret, and Azure Top Secret all have slightly different costs. This is due to the requirements for accreditation, cleared personnel, and facilities. When deciding whether or not to use Azure Top Secret versus Azure Commercial, be sure to know the cost differences between the different environments.

### Know your requirements

All projects include gathering requirements for the workload to be deployed. As you decide which Sovereign Cloud environment to use, be sure to have a current list of requirements. This will ensure that your requirements will be met in the environment (or environments) you select.

Within the Cloud Adoption Framework, [Microsoft provides guidance on how to create a Business Case](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/cloud-migration-business-case).
