Azure Container Apps is a platform that helps manage the release of updates to your container app by creating a new revision each time you make a revision-scope change to your app.

## Scenario

Imagine you have a container app that needs to be updated frequently. You want to manage the release of updates to your container app by creating a new revision each time you make a revision-scope change to your app. You can use revisions to release a new version of your app, quickly revert to an earlier version of your app, split traffic between revisions for A/B testing, and gradually phase in a new revision in blue-green deployments.
