As an organization migrates infrastructure and applications to Azure, network engineers need to ensure that end users have consistent access to the applications, services, and data.

Azure provides load balancing tools to support consistency of access. Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers. This distribution ensures no single server bears too much demand. Load balancing improves application responsiveness and increases availability of applications and services for users. Load balancers also have other capabilities including application security. In this module you learn about using Azure Front Door, and Azure Application Gateway load balancing services.
