Azure Backup provides independent and isolated backups to guard against unintended destruction of the data on your virtual machines. Administrators can implement Azure services to support their backup requirements, including the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent for Azure Backup, the Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS), Azure managed disks snapshots, and Azure Site Recovery.
