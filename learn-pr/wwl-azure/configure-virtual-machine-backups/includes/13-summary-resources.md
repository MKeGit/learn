Azure Backup provides independent and isolated backups to guard against unintended destruction of the data on your virtual machines.

In this module, you identified features and usage cases for different Azure backup methods. You learned how to configure Azure managed disks snapshots and Azure Backup options. You explored how to implement Azure virtual machine backup and restore, including _soft delete_. You discovered how to complete site-to-site recovery by using Azure Site Recovery. You compared the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent for Azure Backup and the Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS).

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Azure Site Recovery enables failover and continued access to applications in the event of an outage. This protection is provided by replicating workloads to a secondary location.

- Azure Backup provides secure backups for virtual machines, allowing for the restoration of entire virtual machines or specific files.

- Both Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup offer features such as consolidated management, reduced cost and complexity, and replication resilience.
