At some point, you might have to decide whether to upgrade or retire company hardware. Several factors will help guide your decision on whether to upgrade or retire a system and purchase net new. First, you must decide whether upgrading is necessary. You base this decision on factors such as the age of the current computers, their performance, and the cost of upgrading compared to continuing to use them.

In most cases, consider the following factors:
- You'll need facilities to store systems undergoing refurbishment and a place to store them until you return them to the user’s workspace.
- You can upgrade software in place at a user’s workstation. However, upgrading an application to a new version requires more planning and testing than managing an update.
- Some organizations have procedures to refurbish used equipment and test stock items before deployment or after users return them. New employees might need fully equipped computers to perform their duties.

### **Retirement**

The retirement phase is an issue that every organization must eventually face. This phase focuses on successfully removing a system from production when it's no longer useful. As you retire legacy systems and replace them with new systems, you must efficiently complete this effort without interrupting daily organizational business needs or end-users work. Eventually, all software systems become obsolete, or other systems supersede them. Hardware systems undergo upgrades, but sometimes you no longer require and should remove them.

Other factors that you must consider when planning the retirement phase include:

- IT professionals should perform computer pickup in a way that causes the least interruptions to users. Typically, you can do this during non-business hours by going to each department or room to retrieve computers. IT departments usually coordinate pickups with the distribution of new systems.
- Like your refurbishing efforts, you should also prepare computers for reselling. If systems will go to an outside entity, ensure that sensitive information stored on hard drives and other magnetic media doesn't travel outside your organization. As part of the retirement process, you should typically remove the data stored on drives. You can use many software tools to do this, and some machines can erase drives in bulk, even if the drives aren't operational.
- Your organization might require administrative processing, which refers to the paperwork necessary to inventory and account for all computer equipment removals and sales. You can accomplish this with an existing inventory system.
- You might need to perform packing and shipping and a loading-dock area for pickups.
- It would be best to consider the equipment’s residual or resale value for accounting. For example, companies assign laptops at a higher price than desktops. Some organizations give old equipment to charity and use such donations as part of their overall tax accommodation.

### **BYOD and Unenrollment**

In BYOD scenarios, users might either replace their devices or leave the organization. The IT department must consider how to address organizational data and applications on the user’s device. They can completely wipe a device, removing all accounts, data, policies, and settings. This action is performed when the device is no longer used or lost. However, in BYOD situations, users will typically not accept IT wiping the device if they leave the company, as they would also lose their personal information.

Services like Microsoft Intune can selectively wipe and remove applications and application data. However, these applications must be managed and support these capabilities. The platform, such as iOS, Android, or Windows, can also be a factor. It would be best if you considered how to remove applications and data before granting access to them. Regardless of which methods you choose for data removal, users should know policies before enrolling devices.
