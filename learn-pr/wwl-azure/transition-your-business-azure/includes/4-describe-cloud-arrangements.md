When your business moves to the cloud, you don’t have to completely commit to Microsoft Azure. If you want, you can split your IT operations between a traditional, in-house arrangement and the cloud.

There are three major models of cloud computing that you should consider during your cloud transition. Read the following descriptions. Your IT team should have insights as to which arrangement makes the most sense for your organization.

## Public Cloud

When we talk about the cloud, we’re mostly talking about the public cloud. In the public cloud, you subscribe to cloud services hosted at Azure’s global datacenters, along with other public cloud customers. A public cloud is the most cost-efficient and flexible cloud arrangement, and lets you easily access the scale and power of Azure. You won’t have direct control over the hardware used, but for many businesses, that’s a burden lifted rather than a problem.

## Private Cloud

Alternatively, some businesses opt for a private cloud. You can think of private cloud as a step up from a traditional, company-owned IT system. A private cloud is cloud technology used by only one organization, at datacenters dedicated to that organization, maybe even on the business’s property. A private cloud allows a company greater control over its IT hardware, but it's more costly to maintain and lacks the scalability, global reach, and reliability of Azure’s public cloud.

A business might opt for a private cloud if, for example, it's legally required to conduct computing operations in a specific place, or to store its data on private hardware isolated from other businesses.

## Hybrid Cloud

Some businesses combine public and private cloud arrangements, or cloud and off-cloud IT, into a hybrid cloud arrangement. In a hybrid cloud arrangement, a business might employ public and private cloud for different purposes. For example, a company that relies on a private cloud might occasionally employ public cloud to handle a surge in computing needs. Or a business may use a private cloud to comply with certain regulations while using public cloud for less sensitive tasks.
