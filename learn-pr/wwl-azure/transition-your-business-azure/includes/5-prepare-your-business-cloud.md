You’ve now reviewed some of the critical considerations your team will have to keep in mind when planning and executing a transition to the cloud.

## The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

When you’re ready to initiate that transition, Microsoft has a resource called the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) that explores more technical and organizational aspects of getting onto Azure. The Framework includes even more instructional materials, templates, and resources your business can consult as you think through your future with the cloud.

Much of the material is similar to what's covered in this learning path, but more technical and action-oriented, **so your IT team should be a part of any discussions using the Cloud Adoption Framework**.

## Preparing Your Team

A major part of transitioning your company to the cloud will be **transitioning your employees into a cloud-based organization and mindset**. It’s easy to see that switching to the cloud will entail a shift in duties, and maybe even titles, for your IT team. However, your entire workforce can be transformed by a shift to cloud-based computing. As you explore cloud possibilities for your business, you’ll have to consider questions like:

 -  What departments will use new software? How will we prepare those departments?
 -  What roles will change or be created by new cloud-based activities?
 -  How will we train our workforce on our cloud tools and policies?
 -  What cloud-based data should each department have access to?
 -  How will the cloud change our inter-departmental communications?

Hold these questions in mind as you review the Cloud Adoption Framework as a company.
