    choices:
    - content: "Run msrdcw.exe"

    - content: "Install the FSLogix agent on the session hosts in HostPoolSouth"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Azure Guest Agent Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Azure Guest Agent Service is responsible for all the logging in WAppAgent.log. This service is responsible for configuring various extensions and communication from Guest to Host."
  - content: "An organization has an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool named HostPool-1 and two session hosts named AVDSessionHost1 and AVDSessionHost1. Additionally, they have App groups named AppRemoteGR1 and AppRemoteGR2 with a RemoteApp named UserRemoteApp-1. They want to prevent users from copying and pasting content from UserRemoteApp-1 to a local computer or device. What should be done to prevent this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Modify the RDP Properties of HostPool-1"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You should set the following RDP property to disable clipboard redirection: redirectclipboard:i:0."
    - content: "Require multifactor authentication (MFA)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. What is multifactor authentication (MFA)? Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds a layer of protection to the sign-in process. When accessing accounts or apps, users provide additional identity verification, such as scanning a fingerprint or entering a code received by phone."
    - content: "Re-register App groups AppRemoteGR1 and AppRemoteGR2"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Re-registering App groups won't prevent users from copying and pasting content. You should set the following RDP property to disable clipboard redirection: redirectclipboard:i:0."
