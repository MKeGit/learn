Microsoft Endpoint Manager integrates with Azure Virtual Desktop to manage and operate deployments efficiently and establish a secure remote work solution.

You can now enroll Azure Virtual Desktop Virtual Machines that are Microsoft Entra hybrid joined (joined to your on-premises Active Directory and registered with your Microsoft Entra ID) with Microsoft Intune and manage them in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center the same way as physical devices.

Microsoft Endpoint Manager simplifies management, provides a centralized view across both physical devices and virtual desktops and opens up new areas of collaboration. The Endpoint Manager integration is generally available for Windows 10 Enterprise desktops. Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session supports policies at device specific scope.
