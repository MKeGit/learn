Azure Network Watcher provides a suite of tools to monitor, diagnose, view metrics, and enable or disable logs for Azure IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) resources. Network Watcher enables you to monitor and diagnose the network health of IaaS products like virtual machines (VMs), virtual networks (VNets), application gateways, and load balancers. You can use Network Watcher to monitor the connections of these IaaS products to resources in Azure such as service endpoints as well as on-premises and other resources.
