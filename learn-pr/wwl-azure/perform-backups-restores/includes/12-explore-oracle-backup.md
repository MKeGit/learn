For backup/restore functionality, the SAP BR\*Tools for Oracle are supported in the same way as they're in on-premises scenarios. Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) is also supported for backups to disk and restores from disk.

For Windows VMs, you can also use Azure Backup to run an application consistent VM backup. The Oracle DBMS releases that are supported on Azure by SAP can use the VSS functionality for backups.
