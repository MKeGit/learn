Using Projects views, you can organize information by changing the layout, grouping, sorting, and filtering your work.

You can create and use different visualizations, for example, Board view:

## Project command palette

Use the project command palette to change settings and run commands in your project.

1.  Open the project command palette by pressing **Command + K (Mac)** or **Ctrl + K (Windows/Linux)**.

 -  Group by: Status.
 -  Remove group-by.

Also, you can perform changes using the interface.

## Creating a project view

Project views allow you to view specific aspects of your project. Each view is displayed on a separate tab in your project.

For example, you can have:

 -  A view that shows all items not yet started (filter on Status).
 -  A view that shows the workload for each team (group by a custom Team field).
 -  A view that shows the items with the earliest target ship date (sort by a date field).

To add a new view:

1.  To open the project command palette, press **Command + K (Mac)** or **Ctrl + K (Windows/Linux)**.
2.  Start typing **New view** (to create a new view) or **Duplicate view** (to duplicate the current view).
3.  Choose the required command.
4.  The new view is automatically saved.
