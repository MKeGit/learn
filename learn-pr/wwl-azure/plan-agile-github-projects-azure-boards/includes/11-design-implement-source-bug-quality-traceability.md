In the context of DevOps, traceability refers to the ability to track changes and actions throughout the software development lifecycle. This concept applies to different aspects of that lifecycle, including changes to source code, bug resolution, and maintaining quality control. Its implementation is essential to ensure product reliability, maintainability, and customer satisfaction.

Source traceability enables developers to track code changes in collaboration scenarios. Bug traceability facilitates identifying, prioritizing, and resolving issues with the source code. Quality traceability ensures that software meets quality standards and user expectations by linking testing activities, metrics, and feedback to development efforts.

## Design

At a high level, traceability is tool-agnostic but the way to approach it depends on the aspect of software development lifecycle it is meant to target. Similarly, objectives and design considerations differ between source code, bug, and quality traceability.

In particular, source traceability involves tracking the history of code changes, including who made the changes, when they were made, and the purpose of the changes. It facilitates code reviews, debugging, and understanding the evolution of the codebase over time. From the design standpoint, this functionality ties closely to Git branching and merging strategies that organize development work. Developers create feature branches for new work, commit changes to their branches, and submit pull requests for review. At that point, their peers conduct code reviews and, once successfully completed, approve the changes to be merged into the main branch.

Bug traceability involves tracing bugs or defects reported during testing or production back to their root cause in the codebase. It also commonly relies on capturing information such as the bug report details, steps to reproduce, affected components, and related code changes. Its objectives include prioritizing and resolving bugs efficiently in order to address software deficiencies.

Quality traceability encompasses tracing quality-related activities and artifacts throughout the software development process. This involves linking quality metrics, test cases, test results, and other quality assurance activities to requirements, user stories, and code changes. Quality traceability helps assess the impact of software changes on its quality and identify areas for improvement.

## Implementing traceability

Traceability implementation details of differ to some extent depending on the DevOps platform.

### Source traceability

Since both GitHub and Azure DevOps support Git as their source control mechanism, a number of source traceability techniques apply to both of them. As the result, implementing source code traceability in both cases involves adopting best practices such as writing descriptive commit messages, using a well-defined branching strategy, and requiring pull requests for code reviews.

However, there are also some differences between them. Implementing source traceability in GitHub repositories typically involves utilizing features such as branch protection rules to enforce code review processes and ensure changes are reviewed before merging. GitHub's integration with Issues allows for linking code changes to corresponding issues, providing traceability between code modifications and project requirements. Azure DevOps offers branch policies and pull request policies for enforcing code quality checks and linking changes to work items, enabling traceability between code changes and user stories or tasks. Additionally, Azure DevOps provides more extensive integration with its work item tracking system, allowing for deeper traceability and reporting capabilities compared to GitHub's issue tracking.

### Bug traceability

In Azure DevOps, bug traceability is facilitated through Azure Boards, where bugs are tracked as work items and can be linked to code changes, commits, and pull requests. Azure Boards allows for creating custom workflows for bug management, defining states such as New, Active, Resolved, and Closed, providing visibility into the bug's lifecycle. Additionally, Azure DevOps offers rich integration between bugs and other work items, enabling traceability between bugs and user stories, tasks, and epics.

In GitHub, bug traceability relies on the integration between issues and code changes, where bugs reported as issues can be linked to commits and pull requests. GitHub Actions offer the ability to implement customizable workflows, including those related to bug traceability. With GitHub Actions, you can define workflows that automate processes triggered by events in your GitHub repository, such as the creation or modification of issues. This allows you to create custom workflows for managing bugs, including defining states, assigning tasks, and automating actions based on specific conditions. Effectively, while GitHub Actions provide flexibility in workflow automation, they typically require more effort and customization compared to the built-in features of Azure Boards in Azure DevOps.

### Quality traceability

In Azure DevOps, quality traceability can be managed using Test Plans, which allow teams to organize, execute, and track test cases. Test Plans provide comprehensive quality metrics, including test case pass rates, test run outcomes, and test coverage reports. Additionally, Azure DevOps offers integration with code coverage tools to measure test coverage and identify areas of the codebase that require additional testing.

GitHub offers similar functionality through GitHub Actions, enabling teams to automate various types of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Here as well, GitHub Actions provides flexibility in setting up test workflows and integrating with third-party testing tools, but they tend to require additional configuration to achieve the same level of comprehensive quality metrics and test coverage reporting as Azure DevOps Test Plans.
