When assigning user account rights, you should keep in mind that some accounts present a greater security risk due to a higher than normal level of privilege. Typically, the built-in privileged accounts and groups in Active Directory, and privileged local accounts on workstations and member servers present the greatest risk.

In these cases, applying the principle of least privilege is critical to minimizing security risk. It’s important, for example, to not allow local Administrator accounts to be used as service accounts on member servers, or to be able to log in to local computers. You can use GPOs to restrict Administrator accounts on domain-joined systems. For example, you can add the Administrator account to the following user rights:

 -  Deny access to this computer from the network.
 -  Deny logon as a batch job.
 -  Deny logon as a service.
 -  Deny logon through Remote Desktop Services.

Denying a user account the right to sign in as a service is a good security best practice because it limits the potential for abuse of service accounts. Attackers often target service accounts because those accounts may be configured with elevated privileges and can run in the background without direct user interaction. Restricting a user account’s ability to sign in as a service reduces the attack surface and the risk of unauthorized access to critical systems and data.

## Preventing unauthorized sign in through service accounts

To deny a user account the ability to sign in as a service using Group Policy, follow these steps:

1.  Open the Group Policy Management Console.
2.  Create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) or modify an existing one.
3.  Edit the GPO and navigate to **User Rights Assignment**, which is located under Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\User Rights Assignment.
4.  Locate and select the policy setting **Deny logon as a service**.
5.  Select **Add User or Group** and then click **Find**.
6.  Select the user account for which you want to deny this right.
7.  Ensure that the policy setting is enabled and then select **OK** to apply the changes.
