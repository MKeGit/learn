Customers use Azure monitoring tools to identify, analyze and troubleshoot issues.

However, the work items related to an issue are typically stored in an ITSM tool.

Instead of having to go back and forth between your ITSM tool and Azure monitoring tools, customers can now get all the information they need in one place.

ITSMC will improve the troubleshooting experience and reduce the time it takes to resolve issues.

IT Service Management Connector (ITSMC) for Azure provides bi-directional integration between Azure monitoring tools and your ITSM tools â€“ ServiceNow, Provance, Cherwell, and System Center Service Manager.

Specifically, you can use ITSMC to:

 -  Create or update work-items (Event, Alert, Incident) in the ITSM tools based on Azure alerts (Activity Log Alerts, Near Real-Time metric alerts, and Log Analytics alerts)
 -  Pull the Incident and Change Request data from ITSM tools into Azure Log Analytics.

You can set up ITSMC by following this overview:
