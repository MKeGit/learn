The Azure Database for PostgreSQL server receives SQL queries and returns the requested data in a result set. The SQL query defines *what* to return, not *how* to return it. Each SQL query received by the server goes through several stages in order to return the correct results as efficiently as possible.

In this module you learn about the different stages of processing a query, and the **EXPLAIN** statement, which returns the execution plan.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Identify the query processing components
- Understand EXPLAIN
