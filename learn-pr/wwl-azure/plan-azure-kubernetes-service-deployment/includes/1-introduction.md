This module covers the core infrastructure components of Kubernetes and how they're used in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Scenario

As application development continues to move towards a container-based approach, there's an increasing need to orchestrate and manage resources. Kubernetes provides reliable scheduling of fault-tolerant application workloads, making it the leading platform for container orchestration. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes offering that further simplifies container-based application deployment and management.

In this module, you learn about the core Kubernetes infrastructure components, including control plane nodes, node pools, and workload resources such as pods, deployments, and sets. You learn how to build and run modern, portable, microservices-based applications using Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage the availability of the application components. Finally, you learn how AKS provides a managed Kubernetes service that reduces the complexity of deployment and core management tasks, like upgrade coordination.<br>
