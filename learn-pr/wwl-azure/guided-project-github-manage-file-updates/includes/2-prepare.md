Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment (IDE). This project will guide you through creating a new GitHub repository via the GitHub web interface, cloning the project to your local computer, and then working both in GitHub’s web interface and on your local machine.

A computer is required to complete this project. A Windows PC is recommended.
