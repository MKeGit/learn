Welcome to this interactive skills validation experience. Completing this module helps prepare you for the *Deploy and manage containers with Azure Kubernetes Service*assessment.

In this guided exercise, you practice creating and configuring an Azure Container Registry and an Azure Kubernetes Server cluster. The guided exercise combines both learning and hands-on practice. The skills validated include:

 -  Provisioning Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
 -  Building a Linux and Windows container images and store them in Azure Container Registry.
 -  Deploying container images to Azure Kubernetes Service.

By the end of this guided exercise, you gain hands-on experience in creating and configuring these services in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> In the guided exercise, you complete an end-to-end project by following step-by-step instructions.
