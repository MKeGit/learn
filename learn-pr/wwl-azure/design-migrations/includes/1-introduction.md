Azure Architects need to design and recommend migration solutions. They need to assess configuration and management requirements for virtual machine, database, and application workloads to design suitable migration strategies for on-premises workloads.

## Meet Tailwind Traders

:::image type="icon" source="../media/tailwind-traders-logo.png":::

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer that operates retail hardware stores across the globe and online. The company currently manages on-premises datacenters to host their retail website. These datacenters also store all the data and streaming video for the company applications.

The IT department is currently responsible for all management tasks for the company's computing hardware and software. The team handles the procurement process to buy new hardware, installs and configures software, and deploys everything throughout the datacenter. These management responsibilities create some obstacles for delivering applications to Tailwind Traders' users and customers in a timely fashion. You're tasked with reviewing available migration options. You need to determine the appropriate options to support the planned migrations for workloads on virtual machines, databases, and applications.
