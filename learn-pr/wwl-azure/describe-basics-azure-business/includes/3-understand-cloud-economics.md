Let’s revisit the core concepts of **cloud economics** mentioned in the previous unit. The **Describe the business benefits of Azure** module explores these concepts in greater detail. It’s also important to have a basic understanding of how to think about business economics and finance in the cloud.

## Capital expenditures vs. operational expenditures

A traditional, off-cloud IT system entails many **capital expenditures**, such as:

 -  Buying equipment.
 -  Paying to house and power that equipment.
 -  Upgrading the systems.
 -  Routine and emergency maintenance.

Capital expenditures are the costs of physically acquiring and caring for your IT capital. Without the cloud, this equipment sets the limits of what your business’s IT capabilities can do. If you want to expand your capabilities or even just reorganize the system, you’re going to have to acquire new IT capital or modify what you have, which will take time and money.

With Microsoft Azure, since you’re connecting to cloud equipment over the Internet, you won’t have to worry about capital expenditures anymore. Instead, you can start strategizing around the more flexible **operational expenditures** of doing whatever you can imagine with Azure:

 -  When you need more computing power, like to handle a seasonal surge in customer activity, your business can quickly subscribe to more power right over the Internet.
 -  When you want to get new software for one or more departments at your business, you can check what Azure has to offer and easily subscribe.
 -  When you want to build a new website or digital product, the infrastructure to support it is already available to you.
 -  If you want to massively expand part of your operations, like gathering data from various branches of your business, your team can set up that system in Azure without touching any physical hardware.

## Transforming your business

Shifting your business’s IT approach into the operational expenditures mindset is the most important idea in cloud economics. Instead of budgeting around your IT equipment, you’ll be budgeting around whatever you can dream of doing in the cloud. With nothing but an Internet connection to Azure, all parts of your business will be able to:

 -  try new things.
 -  adopt new strategies.
 -  and apply the greater computing power to work faster and smarter, to improve your company’s bottom line.

In the following units, you’ll read all about businesses that have transformed their operations after embracing Azure and the power of cloud economics.
