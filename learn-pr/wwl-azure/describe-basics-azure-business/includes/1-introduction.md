Welcome to the **Get to know Microsoft Azure cloud platform: An overview for business professionals** learning path!

This learning path consists of three modules designed for business decision makers looking to learn more about the cloud and Microsoft Azure.

These modules focus on the business aspects of Azure and the cloud without requiring a technical background. If you do have a technical background, this module can help you better understand the business impacts of cloud technology.

After you complete the learning path, you should have a better sense of what the cloud is, what Azure is, how they can benefit a business, and what to anticipate if your business decides to adopt Azure.
