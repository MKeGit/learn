## Lab scenario

In this lab, you'll configure DNS name resolution for Contoso Ltd. You'll create a private DNS zone named contoso.com, link the VNets for registration and resolution, and then create two virtual machines and test the configuration.

## Objectives

- **Task 1**: Create a private DNS Zone
- **Task 2**: Link subnet for auto registration
- **Task 3**: Create Virtual Machines to test the configuration
  - Use a template to create the virtual machines. You can review the [lab template](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/AZ-700-Designing-and-Implementing-Microsoft-Azure-Networking-Solutions/blob/master/Allfiles/Exercises/M01/azuredeploy.json).
  - Use Azure PowerShell to deploy the template.
- **Task 4**: Verify records are present in the DNS zone
