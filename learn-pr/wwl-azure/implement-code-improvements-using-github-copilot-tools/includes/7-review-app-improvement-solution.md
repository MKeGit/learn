Your challenge was to update the APL2007M5SalesReport project in each of the three improvement areas covered during this module:

1. Code quality: Improve the modularity of the **QuarterlySalesReport** method in the following ways:

    - Extract the code that builds report tables to a separate method named DisplayReports. This method should accept the required input parameters and return a Boolean that indicates successful completion.
    - Extract the code that identifies the top three products to a separate method named TopThree.

1. Code reliability: Improve error handling for the **QuarterlyIncomeReport** class.

    - Implement error handling for at least three methods that contribute displaying the sales report.

1. Code security: Ensure that only authenticated users are able to access the methods that contribute to displaying sales information.

    - Restrict access to the **QuarterlySalesReport** method to authenticated users only.
    - Ensure that other methods cannot be accessed by unauthenticated users.

This review describes the Copilot Chat features and prompts used to complete the challenge.

> [!NOTE]
> The responses generated by GitHub Copilot Chat are based on chat history and the context provided by the user. Other factors, such as AI model updates, may also influence responses. Your results should be similar to the results shown below with some variations expected.

The following sections show one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit.

## Code quality improvements

Use the following prompts to improve the modularity of the **QuarterlySalesReport** method:

1. To extract the code that builds report tables to a separate method named DisplayReports, use the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace #selection Extract the code that builds report tables to a separate method named DisplayReports. This method should accept the required input parameters and return a Boolean that indicates successful completion.
    ```

1. Review and then implement the suggested updates.

1. To extract the code that identifies the top three products to a separate method named TopThree, use the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace #selection Extract the code that identifies the top three products to a separate method named TopThree. This method should accept the required input parameters and return a Boolean that indicates successful completion.
    ```

1. Review and then implement the suggested updates.

## Code reliability improvements

Use the following prompts to improve error handling for the **QuarterlyIncomeReport** class:

1. Select the methods that contribute to displaying the sales report and implement error handling for them.

1. To implement error handling for at least three methods that contribute displaying the sales report, use the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace #selection Implement error handling for the selected methods.
    ```

1. Review and then implement the suggested updates.

## Code security improvements

Use the following prompts to ensure that only authenticated users are able to access the methods that contribute to displaying sales information:

1. To restrict access to the **QuarterlySalesReport** method to authenticated users only, use the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace #selection Restrict access to the **QuarterlySalesReport** method to authenticated users only.
    ```

1. Review and then implement the suggested updates.
