Code challenges reinforce what you've learned and help you gain some confidence before proceeding.

## Challenge: Create unit tests

In this challenge exercise, you need to create xUnit unit tests for the methods of a class.

## Prepare your coding environment

You are using the **APL2007M4BankAccount** sample application from the SampleApps folder. Open the **APL2007M4BankAccount** sample application in Visual Studio Code. Ensure that the application builds and runs successfully before you start the challenge.

The **M4BankAccount** sample app contains the following files:

- A `BankAccount` class that represents a bank account. This class has methods to get the account balance, credit or debit the account, transfer money to another account, and others. It also includes various account properties.
- A `Program` class that contains a `Main` method. The Main method creates bank accounts and simulates transactions using the `BankAccount` class.

## Challenge requirements

- Create at least one xUnit unit test for each method in the `BankAccount` class.

- Create a total of at least 12 unique xUnit unit tests.

- All the tests must be visible in the Test Explorer.

- At least one test for each method must pass when you run the tests.

## Challenge instructions

Create xUnit unit tests for the methods in the `BankAccount` class using GitHub Copilot Chat.

Use the following steps to complete this challenge:

1. Open the **APL2007M4BankAccount** folder in Visual Studio Code.

1. Review the project files, and then ensure that the solution builds and runs.

    It can take 10-15 seconds before the app displays output.

1. Add an xUnit test project to your solution. Name the project **BankAccount.UnitTests**.

1. Create the required project references and class files.

1. Use GitHub Copilot Chat to create unit tests. See the challenge requirements for details.

1. Build the solution and ensure that the tests are displayed in the Test Explorer.

1. Run the tests and ensure that the required number of tests run successfully.
