## Scenario

Your organization requires centralized network security for the application virtual network. As the application usage increases, more granular application-level filtering and advanced threat protection is needed. Also, it's expected the application needs continuous updates from Azure DevOps pipelines. You identify these requirements.
+ Azure Firewall is required for security in the app-vnet. 
+ A firewall policy should be configured to help manage access to the application. 
+ A firewall policy **application rule** is required. This rule allows the application access to Azure DevOps so the application code can be updated. 
+ A firewall policy **network rule** is required. This rule allows DNS resolution. 

## Skilling Tasks

+ Create an Azure Firewall.
+ Create and configure a firewall policy.
+ Create an application rule collection.
+ Create a network rule collection.
