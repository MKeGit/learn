In this module, you learned about network security groups (NSGs) in Azure. NSGs are used to limit network traffic to resources in your virtual network by containing a list of security rules. You can associate NSGs with subnets or network interfaces and define rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. 

You also learned how NSG rules are evaluated and processed. Lastly, you learned how application security groups,  allow for grouping virtual machines based on workload.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- Network security groups are essential for controlling network traffic in Azure virtual networks.

- NSG rules are evaluated and processed based on priority and can be created for subnets and network interfaces.

- Effective NSG rules can be achieved by considering rule precedence, intra-subnet traffic, and managing rule priority.

- Application security groups provide an application-centric view of infrastructure and simplify rule management.
