In this module, you were introduced to Windows PowerShell and its functionalities. The following are the key takeaways:

- PowerShell is an automation solution that consists of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration-management framework.
- There are two main PowerShell platforms, Windows PowerShell and PowerShell (originally referred to as PowerShell Core), based on the operating system and edition.
- Users primarily interact with Windows PowerShell through an application that embeds, or hosts, the PowerShell's engine. Two primary hosts that Microsoft provides are the Windows PowerShell console and the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).
- The Windows PowerShell console host can be customized by specifying custom preferences like font size and type, the size, and position of the console window and the screen buffer, the color scheme, and keyboard shortcuts.
- The Windows PowerShell ISE allows for customizing of panes and views. It's a graphical environment that provides a script editor, a debugger, an interactive console, and several auxiliary tools.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a Microsoft script editor that provides a rich and interactive script editing experience.
