Network security is a critical aspect of maintaining a secure and reliable infrastructure. Azure provides a powerful tool called Network Security Group (NSG) that allows organizations to filter network traffic and enforce access controls in their cloud environments. In this training module, we will explore how to utilize Azure NSG to enhance network security and protect your resources.

## Scenario

Imagine your work as a cloud architect for a growing e-commerce company. The company has recently migrated its infrastructure to Microsoft Azure and wants to ensure that network traffic to their resources is secure and restricted to authorized sources. As the responsible architect, you need to implement effective network security measures using Azure NSG.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training module, participants will:

 -  Understand the purpose and benefits of using Azure NSG to filter network traffic.
 -  Learn how to create and configure NSGs to enforce access controls for Azure resources.
 -  Gain insights into how NSGs can be used to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on source, destination, and port.
 -  Understand how to prioritize NSG rules and leverage Azure NSG flow logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
 -  Recognize the role of NSGs in implementing network security best practices in Azure.

## Goals

 -  Enable participants to effectively utilize Azure NSG to filter network traffic and enforce access controls.
 -  Improve participants' understanding of network security concepts in Azure.
 -  Provide participants with hands-on experience in creating and configuring NSGs.
 -  Empower participants to implement network security best practices and restrict unauthorized access to Azure resources.
 -  Enhance participants' ability to monitor and troubleshoot network traffic using NSG flow logs.
