You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic between Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can **specify source and destination**, **port**, and **protocol**.

## Security rules

A network security group contains as many rules as desired, within Azure subscription limits. Each rule specifies the following properties:

<br>

Security rules are evaluated and applied based on the five-tuple (**1. source, 2. source port, 3. destination, 4. destination port, and 5. protocol**) information. You can't create two security rules with the same priority and direction. A flow record is created for existing connections. Communication is allowed or denied based on the connection state of the flow record. The flow record allows a network security group to be stateful. If you specify an outbound security rule to any address over port 80, for example, it's not necessary to specify an inbound security rule for the response to the outbound traffic. You only need to specify an inbound security rule if communication is initiated externally. The opposite is also true. If inbound traffic is allowed over a port, it's not necessary to specify an outbound security rule to respond to traffic over the port.

Existing connections may not be interrupted when you remove a security rule that allowed the connection. Modifying network security group rules will only affect new connections. When a new rule is created or an existing rule is updated in a network security group, it will only apply to new connections. Existing connections are not reevaluated with the new rules.

## How network security groups filter network traffic

You can deploy resources from several Azure services into an Azure virtual network. You can associate zero, or one, network security group to each virtual network subnet and network interface in a virtual machine. The same network security group can be associated to as many subnets and network interfaces as you choose. The following picture illustrates different scenarios for how network security groups might be deployed to **allow network traffic to and from the internet over TCP port 80**:

> [!NOTE]
> Reference the image, along with the following text, to understand how Azure processes inbound and outbound rules for network security groups:

## Inbound traffic

For inbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a subnet first, if there's one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the network interface, if there's one. This process includes intra-subnet traffic as well.

 -  VM1: The security rules in *NSG1* are processed, since it's associated to *Subnet 1* and *VM1* is in *Subnet 1*. Unless you've created a rule that allows port 80 inbound, the **DenyAllInbound** default security rule denies the traffic. The traffic doesn't get evaluated by NSG2 because it's associated with the network interface. If *NSG1* allows port 80 in its security rule, *NSG2* processes the traffic. To allow port 80 to the virtual machine, both *NSG1* and *NSG2* must have a rule that allows port 80 from the internet.
 -  VM2: The rules in *NSG1* are processed because *VM2* is also in *Subnet 1*. Since *VM2* doesn't have a network security group associated to its network interface, it receives all traffic allowed through *NSG1* or is denied all traffic denied by *NSG1*. Traffic is either allowed or denied to all resources in the same subnet when a network security group is associated to a subnet.
 -  VM3: Since there's no network security group associated to *Subnet 2*, traffic is allowed into the subnet and processed by *NSG2*, because *NSG2* is associated to the network interface attached to *VM3*.
 -  VM4: Traffic is allowed to *VM4,* because a network security group isn't associated to *Subnet 3*, or the network interface in the virtual machine. All network traffic is allowed through a subnet and network interface if they don't have a network security group associated to them.

## Outbound traffic

For outbound traffic, Azure processes the rules in a network security group associated to a network interface first, if there's one, and then the rules in a network security group associated to the subnet, if there's one. This process includes intra-subnet traffic as well.

 -  VM1: The security rules in *NSG2* are processed. The **AllowInternetOutbound** default security rule in both *NSG1* and *NSG2* allows the traffic unless you create a security rule that denies port 80 outbound to the internet. If *NSG2* denies port 80 in its security rule, it denies the traffic, and *NSG1* never evaluates it. To deny port 80 from the virtual machine, either, or both of the network security groups must have a rule that denies port 80 to the internet.
 -  VM2: All traffic is sent through the network interface to the subnet, since the network interface attached to *VM2* doesn't have a network security group associated to it. The rules in *NSG1* are processed.
 -  VM3: If *NSG2* denies port 80 in its security rule, it denies the traffic. If *NSG2* doesn't deny port 80, the **AllowInternetOutbound** default security rule in *NSG2* allows the traffic because there's no network security group associated with *Subnet 2*.
 -  VM4: All network traffic is allowed from *VM4,* because a network security group isn't associated to the network interface attached to the virtual machine, or to *Subnet 3*.

## Intra-Subnet traffic

It's important to note that security rules in an NSG associated to a subnet can affect connectivity between VMs within it. By default, virtual machines in the same subnet can communicate based on a default NSG rule allowing intra-subnet traffic. If you add a rule to *NSG1* that denies all inbound and outbound traffic, *VM1* and *VM2* won't be able to communicate with each other.

You can easily view the aggregate rules applied to a network interface by **viewing the effective security rules** for a network interface. You can also use the **IP flow verify** capability in Azure Network Watcher to determine whether communication is allowed to or from a network interface. You can use IP flow verify to determine whether a communication is allowed or denied. Additionally, Use IP flow verify to surface the identity of the network security rule responsible for allowing or denying the traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> Network security groups are associated to subnets or to virtual machines and cloud services deployed in the classic deployment model, and to subnets or network interfaces in the Resource Manager deployment model.

> [!TIP]
> Unless you have a specific reason to, we recommend that you associate a network security group to a subnet, or a network interface, but not both. Since rules in a network security group associated to a subnet can conflict with rules in a network security group associated to a network interface, you can have unexpected communication problems that require troubleshooting.
