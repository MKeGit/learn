    choices:
    - content: "FileStorage storage account"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. FileStorage storage accounts allow you to deploy Azure file shares on premium/solid-state disk-based (SSD-based) hardware. FileStorage accounts can only be used to store Azure file shares; no other storage resources (blob containers, queues, tables, etc.) can be deployed in a FileStorage account."
    - content: "General purpose version 2 (GPv2) storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. General-purpose v2 storage accounts support the latest Azure Storage features and incorporate all of the functionality of general-purpose v1 and Blob storage accounts."
    - content: "Premium block blobs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Premium block blob storage accounts make data available via high-performance hardware. Data is stored on solid-state drives (SSDs) which are optimized for low latency."
