This unit compares storage solutions that Azure offers for Azure Virtual Desktop FSLogix user profile containers.

As mentioned in Module 2, it's best to store FSLogix profile containers on Azure Files.

FSLogix is designed to roam profiles in remote computing environments, such as Azure Virtual Desktop.

 -  At sign-in, this container is dynamically attached to the computing environment using a natively supported Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) and a Hyper-V Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX).
 -  The user profile is immediately available and appears in the system exactly like a native user profile.

The following tables compare the storage solutions Azure Storage offers for Azure Virtual Desktop FSLogix profile container user profiles.

## Azure Files tiers

Azure Files offers two different tiers of storage: **premium** and **standard**. These tiers let you tailor the performance and cost of your file shares to meet your scenario's requirements.

 -  **Premium file shares are backed by solid-state drives (SSDs)** and are deployed in the FileStorage storage account type. Premium file shares provide consistent high performance and low latency for input and output (IO) intensive workloads.
 -  **Standard file shares are backed by hard disk drives (HDDs)** and are deployed in the general purpose version 2 (GPv2) storage account type. Standard file shares provide reliable performance for IO workloads that are less sensitive to performance variability, such as general-purpose file shares and dev/test environments.

The following table lists our recommendations for which performance tier to use based on your workload.

| **Workload type**            | **Recommended file tier**                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light (fewer than 200 users) | Standard file shares                                      |
| Light (more than 200 users)  | Premium file shares or standard with multiple file shares |
| Medium                       | Premium file shares                                       |
| Heavy                        | Premium file shares                                       |
| Power                        | Premium file shares                                       |
