  - content: "An organization has an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool with twenty Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session hosts. The users connect to the Azure Virtual Desktop deployment from Windows 10 computers. The administrator plans on using FSLogix Application Masking to deploy Application Masking rule sets. Where should the rule sets be copied?"
    choices:
    - content: "Office Container"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Azure Storage account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, file shares, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that's accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS."
    - content: "C:\\Program Files\\FSLogix\\Apps\\Rules on every session host"

    choices:
    - content: "Office Container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Office Container redirects only areas of the profile that are specific to Microsoft Office, and is a subset of Profile Container. Office Container enables and enhances the Microsoft Office experience in non-persistent environments."
    - content: "Profile Container"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Profile Container is used to redirect the full user profile. Profile Container is used in non-persistent, virtual environments, such as Virtual Desktops. Profile Container redirects the entire user profile to a remote location."
    - content: "Kubernetes"
      isCorrect: false
