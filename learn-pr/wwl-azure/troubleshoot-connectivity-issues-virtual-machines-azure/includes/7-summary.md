As your company's support engineer, you explore the differences between Bastion and JIT VM access. You can now provide guidance to your teams and suggest which access method supports their needs.

You then reviewed common issues with both approaches and how to troubleshoot them.

If Bastion or JIT VM access wasn't available, organizations would have to make commonly used ports open to the external internet, allowing bad actors to port scan their virtual machines. Using either approach to connect to your VMs greatly reduces the attack surface that can be exploited.

Now that you completed this module, you should be able to:

- Choose between Azure Bastion or just-in-time VM access.

- Troubleshoot issues with Azure Bastion.

- Troubleshoot just-in-time VM access.
