You work as a support engineer looking after your company’s virtual machines (VMs). Some of the teams you support would like guidance on when to use Azure Bastion or just-in-time (JIT) to access their VMs. You want to be able to give them this guidance and show the teams how to troubleshoot any issues they have.

Azure supports connecting to VMs in multiple ways. Azure Bastion is a service that you deploy into your environment and use it to connect to your VM using only a browser. Just-in-time VM access is a way to restrict who and which services can connect to a VM—and for how long.

In this module, you explore why you might use Azure Bastion instead of just-in-time VM access to connect to your organization’s VMs. Then, you review common issues and how to troubleshoot them.
