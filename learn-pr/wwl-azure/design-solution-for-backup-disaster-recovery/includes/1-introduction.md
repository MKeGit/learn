:::image type="icon" source="../media/tailwind-traders.png" border="false":::

Tailwind Traders is a fictitious home improvement retailer. The company currently manages on-premises data centers to host their retail website. The data centers also store all the data and streaming video for the web applications.

The IT department performs all management tasks for the computing hardware and software. They handle the procurement process to buy new hardware, install and configure software, and deploy everything throughout the data center. These management responsibilities create some obstacles for delivering applications to Tailwind Traders' users and customers in a timely fashion. So, the company is shifting on-premises workloads to the cloud.

You're responsible for selecting appropriate backup solutions for migrated workloads. You also need to select an appropriate disaster recovery option for these workloads.
