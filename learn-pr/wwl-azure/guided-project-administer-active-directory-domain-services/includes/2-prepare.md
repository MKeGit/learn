This is a guided project, where you complete a series of tasks. It is essential to complete the units in order. Each unit requires resources and configuration from previous units in order to function correctly.

## Project overview

In this guided project, you go through the major steps of creating, configuring, and maintaining a domain controller. You also have the opportunity to promote a domain controller.

## Setup

To reduce resource access requirements (such as access to Windows Server or a Microsoft Azure subscription), this guided project uses a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine to run a virtualized environment. You configure a Windows 10 or Windows 11 computerâ€™s Hyper-V subsystem to support the two Windows Server 2022 Evaluation Edition virtual machines that you use in this project. You require the Professional or Enterprise edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11 to perform these tasks.

The computer that functions as the Hyper-V virtualization host should have at least 16 GB of RAM. You can also use an evaluation version of Windows Server with the Hyper-V role installed as the host for these virtual machines, or to configure a third-party virtualization platform to host both virtual machines. The exercises and tasks in this lab use Windows 11 when describing the Hyper-V host. The options presented here make it easy to locate large virtual machine files if you want to remove the configuration after you finish with the project.

The Setup section consists of three main tasks:

 -  Install Hyper-V
 -  Create Windows Server Domain Controller Virtual Machine
 -  Create Windows Server Domain Member Server

Launch the exercise and follow the instructions. When you're done, be sure to return to this page so you can continue learning.
