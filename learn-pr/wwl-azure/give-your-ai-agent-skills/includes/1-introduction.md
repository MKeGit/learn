One of the core features of the Semantic Kernel SDK is that it allows developers to combine native code with the power of large language models (LLMs). Plugins containing native functions can be used to extend the functionality of your artificially intelligent (AI) agent. These native functions can perform a wide range of tasks, from complex calculations to personalized recommendations.

Suppose you want to create a smart music service that can provide a personalized listening experience. You can use native functions to interact with a music library, add songs to a user's "Recently Played" list, and then use a semantic prompt to recommend songs and concerts.

In this module, you learn how native functions work in the Semantic Kernel SDK. You can understand how native functions accomplish customized tasks, effectively giving your AI agent a "skill."
