PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database that runs on macOS, Linux, Unix, and Windows. A [worldwide team of volunteers](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/) built PostgreSQL and currently maintains it. The source code is freely available, and no single commercial organization owns or controls PostgreSQL.
