Azure Automation runbooks are provided to help eliminate the time it takes to build custom solutions.

The runbooks have already been built by Microsoft and the Microsoft community.

You can use them with or without modification.

Also, you can import runbooks from the runbook gallery at Azure Automation Github in the runbooks repository [Azure Automation - Runbooks](https://github.com/azureautomation/runbooks).

> [!NOTE]
> The **AzureRM** PowerShell module has been officially deprecated as of February 29, 2024. Users are advised to migrate from AzureRM to the Az PowerShell module to ensure continued support and updates.
For more general details on the new Az PowerShell module, go to [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).

3.  From the runbook gallery, locate the runbook item you want, select it, and select **Import**.
