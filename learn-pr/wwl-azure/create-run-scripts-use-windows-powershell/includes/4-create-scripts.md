If you can't find a script that meets your needs, you can create your own script. You can still use resources such as the PowerShell Gallery and the internet to find code snippets that are useful in building that script, so you don't need to create all the code.

Scripting is very powerful. You can make changes to many objects, computers, or files very quickly. When you create and test scripts, it's likely that you'll make mistakes. Some of those mistakes result in error messages. Other mistakes cause damage such as deleting objects or files. You should test your scripts in a development or test environment. Ideally, this environment should closely mimic your production environment. By testing in an isolated environment, you reduce the risk of causing damage with your scripts.

When you build your scripts, do so incrementally. Identify a logical order for the task you're trying to accomplish and build the script in parts. This allows you to test each part during development and verify that it works as expected. For example, if you're creating a script to modify all users that are members of a group, the task will have two parts: a query that identifies the members of the group and a section that modifies the users. When you develop the syntax required to modify the users, you should modify a single user until you get the syntax correct.
