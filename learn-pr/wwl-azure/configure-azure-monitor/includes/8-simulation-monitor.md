+ **Task 3**: Create and configure an Azure Monitor Logs (Log Analytics) workspace and Azure Automation-based solutions.
    + Review Azure virtual machine monitoring options.
    + Review the list of available metrics.
+ **Task 4**: Review default monitoring settings of Azure virtual machines.
+ **Task 5**: Configure Azure virtual machine diagnostic settings.
    + Review the Azure virtual machine monitoring settings and enable guest-level monitoring.
    + Enable Azure Monitor Agent and available metrics.  
+ **Task 6**: Review Azure Monitor functionality.
    + Configure Azure Monitor metrics.
    + Create an alert rule based on average percentage CPU.
    + Configure notifications for an action group.
    + Trigger increased CPU utilization and review alert notifications.
