Microsoft Defender for Cloud can monitor the security posture of your non-Azure machines, but first you need to connect them to Azure.

You can connect your non-Azure computers in any of the following ways:

 -  Onboarding with Azure Arc:
     -  By using Azure Arc-enabled servers (recommended).
     -  By using the Azure portal.
 -  [Onboarding directly with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/azure/defender-for-cloud/onboard-machines-with-defender-for-endpoint)

This module describes the methods for onboarding with Azure Arc.

If you're connecting machines from other cloud providers, see [Connect your AWS account](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-aws) or [Connect your GCP project](/azure/defender-for-cloud/quickstart-onboard-gcp). The multicloud connectors for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in Defender for Cloud transparently handle the Azure Arc deployment for you.
