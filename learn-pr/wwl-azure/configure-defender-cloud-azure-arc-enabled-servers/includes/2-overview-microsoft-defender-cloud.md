Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that is made up of security measures and practices that are designed to protect cloud-based applications from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Defender for Cloud combines the capabilities of:

 -  A development security operations (DevSecOps) solution that unifies security management at the code level across multicloud and multiple-pipeline environments.
 -  A cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution that surfaces actions that you can take to prevent breaches.
 -  A cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) with specific protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads.

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal helps security teams investigate attacks across cloud resources, devices, and identities. Microsoft 365 Defender provides an overview of attacks, including suspicious and malicious events that occur in cloud environments. Microsoft 365 Defender accomplishes this goal by correlating all alerts and incidents, including cloud alerts and incidents.
