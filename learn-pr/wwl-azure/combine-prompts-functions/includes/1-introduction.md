The Semantic Kernel SDK allows developers to run functions within prompts to create intelligent applications. Functions nested within your prompts can perform a wide range of tasks to make your AI agent more robust. This allows you to perform tasks that large language models can't typically complete on their own.

For example, you can design a prompt with a function that can complete a designated item on a user's to-do list. Or you could design a prompt that uses a function to retrieve the user's music preferences and provide personalized concert recommendations. Nesting functions within prompts allows you to create complex interactions and provide more value to your users.

In this module, you learn how to combine functions and prompts with the Semantic Kernel SDK.
