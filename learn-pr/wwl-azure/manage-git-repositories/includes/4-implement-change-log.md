The concept of a changelog is simple enough: It's a file that has a list of changes made to a project, usually in date order. The typical breakdown is to separate a list of versions, and then within each version, show:

 -  Added features
 -  Modified/Improved features
 -  Deleted features

Some teams will post changelogs as blog posts; others will create a CHANGELOG.md file in a GitHub repository.

## Automated change log tooling

While changelogs can be created and manually maintained, you might want to consider using an automated changelog creation tool. At least as a starting point.

## Using native GitHub commands

The git log command can be useful for automatically creating content. Example: create a new section per version:

```Bash
git log [options] vX.X.X..vX.X.Y | helper-script > projectchangelogs/X.X.Y

```

## Git changelog

One standard tool is [gitchangelog](https://pypi.org/project/gitchangelog/). This tool is based on Python.

## GitHub changelog generator

Another standard tool is called [github-changelog-generator.](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator)

```Bash
$ github_changelog_generator -u github-changelog-generator -p TimerTrend-3.0

```

This tool is based on Gem.

## Should you use autogenerated log-based data?

Preference is always to avoid dumping log entries into a changelog. Logs are "noisy," so it's easy to generate a mess that isn't helpful.
