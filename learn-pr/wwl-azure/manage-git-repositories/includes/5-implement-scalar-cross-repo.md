As software projects grow in complexity and scale, traditional Git workflows may encounter challenges that impede efficiency and collaboration. These challenges can be addressed through a comprehensive repository management strategy that includes techniques such as Scalar and cross-repo sharing.

## Scalar

Scalar is a Git virtual file system extension developed by Microsoft that optimizes performance when managing large repositories, resulting in accelerated cloning and checkout operations. This is accomplished by using a combination of caching and background maintenance.

When Scalar is used to clone a Git repository, it will cache the repository's metadata and store it locally on the user's machine. This metadata includes information about the repository's branches, tags, and commit history. By caching this data, Scalar can significantly reduce the time it takes to clone the repository. Subsequent Git operations can then use the cached data, further improving performance.

Scalar also uses background maintenance to keep the cached metadata up to date. This means that Scalar will periodically fetch any changes to the repository and update the cached metadata accordingly. By doing this, Scalar ensures that the cached data is always current and accurate, which helps to further improve performance.

## Cross-repository sharing

Cross-repository sharing refers to the practice of sharing code, dependencies, and resources across multiple Git repositories within an organization. This promotes code reuse, collaboration, and maintainability by leveraging shared components and libraries across projects.

## Scaling and optimizing Git repositories

When designing an organizational strategy that supports scaling and optimization of Git repositories, you should account for several key considerations.

### Implementing Scalar for large repositories

Assess the size and complexity of each repository in your organization. Identify those of larger sizes and contain significant amounts of historical data. Consider implementing Scalar to improve their performance and reduce resource usage. Follow Microsoft's guidance on configuring Scalar to prefetch and cache data in a manner that optimizes performance.

### Optimizing repository structure

Evaluate the current structure of your Git repositories. Consider breaking down large monolithic repositories into smaller, more manageable ones, each focusing on a specific component or module. Adopt a modular approach to the way repositories are organized. Use Git submodules or Git sub repositories to manage dependencies between repositories while promoting code reuse and sharing across projects.

Git submodules provide a way to include a Git repository as a subdirectory within another Git repository. This is useful when you want to include external code or libraries in your project. When you add a Git submodule, Git creates a text file called a ".gitmodules" file that contains information about the submodule, including its URL and the commit it's currently pointing to.

Git sub repositories represent a newer approach to including a Git repository as a subdirectory within another Git repository. Unlike submodules, sub repositories are managed by a separate tool called "git-subrepo" and don't require a separate ".gitmodules" file. Additionally, sub repositories can be split off into their own standalone repositories at any time, while submodules always remain as part of the main repository.

### Promoting cross-repository sharing

Establish clear guidelines and best practices for sharing code and resources across repositories within your organization. Encourage the use of Git submodules or Git sub repositories to reference shared components or libraries hosted in separate repositories.

As part of your design, consider a centralized package registry or artifact repository to publish and consume shared dependencies consistently across projects.<br>Ensure to clearly communicate your strategy throughout the organization. Foster collaboration between teams to identify opportunities for code sharing and reuse and implement it based on your guidance.
