Azure Monitor Logs is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects and organizes log and performance data from monitored resources. A Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment for log data from Azure Monitor and other Azure services. Each workspace has its own data repository and configuration but might combine data from multiple services.

For example, a Log Analytics workspace allows you to collect data from:

- Azure resources in your subscription.
- Virtual machine agents.
- Application and performance usage data from Azure Monitor application insights.
- Diagnostics or log data from Azure Storage.

All of this disparate data can be consolidated into a single workspace for analysis. A workspace has a unique workspace ID and resource ID. The workspace name must be unique for a given resource group. After you've created a workspace, configure data sources and solutions to store their data there.

To create a Log Analytics workspace, perform the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, enter Log Analytics in the search box. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Log Analytics workspaces**.
1. Select **Add**.
1. Select a Subscription from the dropdown.
1. Use an existing Resource Group or create a new one.
1. Provide a name for the new Log Analytics workspace, such as DefaultLAWorkspace. This name must be unique per resource group.
1. Select an available Region.
1. Select **Review + Create** to review the settings. Then select **Create** to create the workspace. A default pricing tier of pay-as-you-go is applied. No charges will be incurred until you start collecting enough data.

Once you've configured the workspace and data is being logged, you can analyze it together using a sophisticated query language that's capable of quickly analyzing millions of records. You might start with a simple sample query that answers a common question, or perform sophisticated data analysis to identify critical patterns in your monitoring data. You can work with log queries and their results interactively using Log Analytics, use them in an alert rule to be proactively notified of issues, or visualize their results in a workbook or dashboard.
