Azure Service Health monitors the health of your cloud resources, including Log Analytics workspaces. When a Log Analytics workspace is healthy, data you collect from resources in your IT environment is available for querying and analysis in a relatively short period of time, measured as latency. When Azure Service Health detects average latency in your Log Analytics workspace, the workspace resource health status is Available.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Log Analytics workspace. Under **Monitoring**, select the **Alerts** section and then under **Enable recommended alert** rules click **View + enable**.
