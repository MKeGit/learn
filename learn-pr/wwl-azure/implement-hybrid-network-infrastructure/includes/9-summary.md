Before the Contoso IT team can modernize the current operational model, they'll need to configure networking between their on-premises environment and any Windows Server IaaS VMs running in Azure.

In this module, you learned how to connect your on-premises environment to Azure so that workloads in each location can communicate with each other. You also learned how to implement subnets and routing between your on-premises and cloud environments. Finally, you learned how to ensure that workloads in the cloud and on-premises can perform DNS resolution to locate each other.

Now that you can connect your on-premises environment to Azure, you can assist the IT Team in modernizing Contoso's current operational model.
