You can configure networking between your organization's on-premises environment and Windows Server IaaS VMs running in Azure.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts. Contoso IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2019.

Contosoâ€™s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals.

In this module, you learn how to connect your on-premises environment to Azure so that workloads in each location can communicate with each other. You'll also learn how to implement subnets and routing between your on-premises and cloud environments. Finally, you learn how to ensure that workloads in the cloud and on-premises can perform DNS resolution to locate each other.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe Azure network topologies.
- Implement an Azure virtual private network (VPN).
- Explain how to create a route-based VPN gateway using the Azure portal.
- Implement Azure ExpressRoute.
- Implement an Azure wide area network (WAN).
- Implement DNS resolution in hybrid environments
