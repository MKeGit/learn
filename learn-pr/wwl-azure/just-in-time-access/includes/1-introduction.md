This module covers understanding just-in-time (JIT) VM access, addressing risks of open management ports, and implementing JIT with Microsoft Defender for Cloud to enhance security in Azure and AWS environments.

## Scenario

Imagine you're responsible for securing your company's virtual machines in Azure and AWS. Understanding just-in-time (JIT) VM access is crucial. Threat actors target open management ports, like RDP or SSH, to infiltrate your network. By implementing JIT with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can lock down these ports, allowing temporary access only to authorized users. This reduces the attack surface and enhances the overall security of your cloud environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training module, participants will:

 -  Understand the risks associated with open management ports on virtual machines.
 -  Learn how to implement JIT VM access using Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
 -  Explore how JIT VM access reduces attack surfaces in Azure and AWS environments.
 -  Gain skills to configure and manage temporary, controlled access to VMs for authorized users.

## Goals

By the end of this module, you'll understand JIT VM access, know how to implement it with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, reduce attack surfaces in Azure and AWS, and manage temporary access to VMs.
