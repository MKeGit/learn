As the project manager for a manufacturer, you utilize RISE with SAP on Microsoft Cloud to optimize business procedures, enhance teamwork, and automate tasks. Additionally, you explore the potential of Microsoft Power Platform, familiarize yourself with the features of Microsoft Copilot Studio, and understand how Microsoft Teams and SAP work together under RISE with SAP.

## Explore deployment options

There are a range of deployment options for combining RISE with SAP and the Microsoft Cloud:

- **RISE with SAP**: A fully managed SAP service that handles all underlying infrastructure, enabling businesses to concentrate on their core operations.
- **Customer managed VMs on Azure**: Businesses retain greater control over their SAP systems by managing their own virtual machines (VMs) on Azure. SAP on Azure VMs is a solution for businesses with specific customization needs or those desiring more hands-on control.
- **On-premises**: RISE with SAP on Microsoft Cloud accommodates on-premises deployments for businesses that prefer to maintain their SAP systems on-premises.

Many of the following Microsoft integration strategies for RISE with SAP apply equally to SAP running in Azure VMs or on-premises, offering a wide range of options to suit different business needs and contexts. Regardless of the deployment option chosen, Azure networking and Microsoft Entra ID ensure seamless integration and secure access. Entra ID use across products is beneficial for businesses with strict data sovereignty requirements, or businesses who want to use their existing infrastructure.
