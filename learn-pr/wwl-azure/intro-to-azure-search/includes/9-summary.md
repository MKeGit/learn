In this module, you explored Azure AI Search, Microsoft's Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution that provides the infrastructure and tools to create scalable and rich search experiences. The module gave an overview of how the Azure AI Search indexing pipeline ingests unstructured data, serializes the information in JSON, performs AI enrichment, and brings data to a search index.

Other takeaways include understanding the connection between index and query design, with the index schema determining the possible queries. You also learned how the Azure portal's Import data wizard can be used to automate indexing. After reading this module, you can understand how Azure AI Search streamlines the search for insights from all types of media.
