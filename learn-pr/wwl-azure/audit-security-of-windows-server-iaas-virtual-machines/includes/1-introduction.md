You can use the Azure Security Center to assess the security configuration of your Azure VM resources and the Windows Server operating system (OS) that's running on the VM.

## Scenario

Contoso is a medium-size financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Most of its compute environment runs on-premises on Windows Server. This includes virtualized workloads on Windows Server 2012 R2 hosts. Contoso IT staff are in the process of migrating Contoso servers to Windows Server 2019.

Contoso’s IT director realizes that Contoso has an outdated operational model with limited automation and reliance on dated technology. The Contoso IT Engineering team has started exploring Azure capabilities. They want to determine whether Azure services might assist with modernizing the current operational model through automation and virtualization.

As part of the initial design, the Contoso IT team asked you, their lead system engineer and server administrator, to set up a proof of concept environment. This environment must verify whether Azure services can help to modernize the IT infrastructure and meet business goals.

Securing VM resources both in Azure and on-premises is important to the IT staff at Contoso. In this module, you'll learn about Azure Security Center and how to enable it in hybrid environments. You'll learn how to onboard Windows Server computers to Security Center, and how to use it to protect your resources. You'll also learn about Azure Sentinel, security information and event management (SIEM), and security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR).
