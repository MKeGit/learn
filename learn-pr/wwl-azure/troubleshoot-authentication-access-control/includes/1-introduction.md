You work as an administrator looking after your company’s Microsoft Entra authentication and access control. Because authentication and access control is crucial to the robust, secure, and effective functioning of both Azure-based and hybrid systems, you can react both proactively and reactively to any authentication and authorization issues.

Microsoft Azure has a sophisticated authentication and access control system to provide high security. Microsoft Entra authentication includes self-service password reset, multifactor authentication, hybrid integration, and passwordless authentication.

In this module, you’ll learn how to troubleshoot a deployment of Microsoft Entra ID that is based entirely in the cloud and a hybrid deployment of Microsoft Entra ID that is part cloud-based and part on-premises. You'll also learn how to troubleshoot authorization issues when using Microsoft Azure.
