  title: "Knowledge check"
  questions:
  - content: "You're planning Azure Stack HCI-based deployment of Contoso's business critical workloads that must be protected from cyber threats even if there's a successful exploit of the operating system running on the cluster nodes. You already purchased Azure Stack HCI hardware that supports trusted enterprise virtualization. What should you do next?"
    choices:
    - content: "Integrate Azure Stack HCI with Azure Defender."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is an optional step. Although it provides cloud-based advanced security management and threat detection benefits for on-premises workloads, it's not sufficient to protect business critical workloads if there's a successful exploit of the operating system running on the cluster nodes."
    - content: "Enable Credential Guard."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Credential Guard protects cached sign-in credentials by storing them in virtual secure mode, which is not sufficient to protect business critical workloads if there's a successful exploit of the operating system running on the cluster nodes."
    - content: "Enable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Although HVCI is available on Azure Stack HCI certified hardware, it's not automatically enabled. To enable it, use Group Policy or direct registry changes."
