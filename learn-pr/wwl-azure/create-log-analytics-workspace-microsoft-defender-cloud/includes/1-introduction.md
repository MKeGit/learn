A Log Analytics workspace is a data store into which you can collect any type of log data from all of your Azure and non-Azure resources and applications. We recommend that you send all log data to one Log Analytics workspace, unless you have specific business needs that require you to create multiple workspaces, as described in [Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design).

## Scenario

Imagine you are an Azure Security Engineer using a Log Analytics workspace to collect data from Azure and non-Azure resources, enabling centralized monitoring, custom alerts, and advanced threat detection to enhance security and compliance across a hybrid cloud environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this training module, participants will:

1.  Understand the importance of a centralized logging solution like Azure Log Analytics workspace for Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
2.  Learn how to create and configure a Log Analytics workspace in Azure.
3.  Gain insights into collecting and analyzing security data from Microsoft Defender for Cloud within the Log Analytics workspace.
4.  Understand how to create custom queries and alerts to proactively detect security threats and incidents.
5.  Recognize the benefits of integrating Log Analytics workspace with other Azure services and tools.

## Goals

 -  Enable participants to create a dedicated Log Analytics workspace for Microsoft Defender for Cloud in Azure.
 -  Enhance participants' understanding of the capabilities and benefits of a centralized logging solution.
 -  Provide participants with hands-on experience in configuring and managing Log Analytics workspace.
 -  Empower participants to effectively collect, analyze, and monitor security data from Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
 -  Improve participants' ability to proactively detect and respond to security threats by leveraging custom queries and alerts.
 -  Highlight the advantages of integrating Log Analytics workspace with other Azure services and tools for comprehensive security operations.
