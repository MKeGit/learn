This module covers the deployment of a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Scenario

Imagine your work for a company that needs to deploy and manage a Kubernetes cluster. You have heard about Azure Kubernetes Service and want to learn how to use it to simplify the process. In this module, you learn how to create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster, configure its components, and connect to it using kubectl commands. You learn how to use advanced networking, Azure Microsoft Entra ID integration, and monitoring features. The recommended baseline infrastructure architecture to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster on Azure is provided in this module.
