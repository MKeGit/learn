You are tasked with validating your company's planned cheese shipping container monitoring and tracking system upgrade. The planned tracking device system upgrade uses Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS) and X.509 certificate authentication for IoT device autoprovisioning and deprovisioning. 

You used code to test and validate that the Azure IoT Hub DPS provisioning and deprovisioning with X.509 certificate authentication capabilities fit your company's planned system upgrade.

If you and your company didn't validate the IoT Hub DPS with X.509 certificate authentication provisioning and deprovisioning process, you wouldn't know if the process would work for your planned system upgrade.

You validated the process and it prepared you to provide detailed input into planning for your company's system update.
