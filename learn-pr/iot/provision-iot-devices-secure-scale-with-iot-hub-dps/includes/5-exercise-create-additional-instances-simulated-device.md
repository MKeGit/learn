In this exercise, you make copies of your simulated device project, and then update your code to use the different device certificates that you created and added to the project folder.

### Task 1: Make copies of your code project

1. In Visual Studio Code or your file explorer, copy the **ContainerDevice.csproj** and **Program.cs** files from **sensor-thl-001-device** folder into the **sensor-thl-002-device** folder.

1. In both files, replace the certificate file name to match the certificate file in this folder: **sensor-thl-002-device.cert.pfx**.

1. Save your changes.

If you want to create more devices to enroll with your DPS instance, you can do so by creating a new device certificate and repeating these steps.

## Verify your work

1. Navigate your file manager to the **sensor-thl-002-device** folder.
1. Verify that the files contained in the **sensor-thl-002-device** folder match the changes you made in task 1 of this unit.
