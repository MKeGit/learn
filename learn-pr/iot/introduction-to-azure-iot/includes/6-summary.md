Now that you've completed this module, you can decide whether the Azure IoT services are appropriate to your specific IoT scenario:

- Do the Azure IoT services provide the capabilities you need to implement your solution?
- Do you understand the architecture of a typical IoT solution?
- Do you have the skills to implement your solution using the Azure IoT services?

You could use either IoT Central or a custom solution that uses IoT Hub to create a connected coffee machine solution. Using IoT Central would let you build the solution quickly, a custom solution would let you tailor the solution to your exact requirements. In both scenarios you need to implement the device code for your connected coffee machine.

Building an IoT solution for your connected coffee machine will help you to:

- Manage your coffee machines remotely.
- Monitor the status of your coffee machines.
- Automate business processes such as notifying the maintenance department when a coffee machine needs servicing.
