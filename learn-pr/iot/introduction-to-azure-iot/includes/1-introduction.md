The Azure Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of Microsoft-managed cloud services, edge components, and SDKs that let you build solutions to connect, monitor, and control your IoT assets at scale. In simpler terms, an IoT solution is made up of IoT devices that communicate with one or more Azure cloud services.

## Example scenario

Suppose you work at a coffee machine company as the IT expert. Your company plans to launch a range of IoT enabled coffee machines. Your company wants to monitor these coffee machines and be able to manage issues remotely. For example, if a coffee machine is in warranty and the water temperature is outside the expected range then the maintenance department should be notified.

## What will you be doing?

You'll learn about:

- The typical components and architecture of an IoT solution.
- The capabilities of the various Azure IoT services and SDKs.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether the Azure IoT services are appropriate to your specific IoT scenario.
