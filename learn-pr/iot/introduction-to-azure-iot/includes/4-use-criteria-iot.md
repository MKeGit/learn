Here you'll learn about how to decide whether Azure IoT is the right choice for your application.

The decision of how you can use Azure IoT to build your IoT solution is ultimately determined by:

- Your business requirements
- The type of solution you want to develop
- Your organization's skill set in Azure IoT technologies

A more comprehensive list of considerations includes:

|  | Question |
|---|---|
| **Business process realignment** | Do you plan to use IoT to realign your organization's business processes? |
| **Cloud expertise** | Does your team have minimal cloud expertise? |
| **Time series data** | Do you need to analyze large-scale time-series data? |
| **Offload processing to IoT Edge devices** | Do you plan to offload processing to edge devices? |
| **Scale** | Do you need to manage IoT assets at scale? |
| **Modeling physical spaces** | Do you need to model a physical space? |
| **Secure IoT devices** | Do you need to manage and secure devices? |

The Azure IoT services and SDKs can help implement an IoT solution if the answer to some or all of the above questions is yes.
