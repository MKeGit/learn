title: Explore the Azure Digital Twins API for creating a graph
summary: >
  Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs to create models, twins, and relationships; gather information about the elements you created; query the graph; and add endpoints and event routes.
abstract: | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to...
  - Set up Postman structure and permissions to manage Azure Digital Twins API requests.
  - Identify key Azure Digital Twins actions that can be performed with the APIs.
  - Construct Azure Digital Twins API requests for import jobs, models, twins, queries, endpoints, and event routes.
prerequisites: |
  - Beginner level knowledge of HTTP, REST services, and APIs.
  - Understanding of how models, twins, and relationships are used in an Azure Digital Twins solution.
  - An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free), and permission to manage access to Azure resources in the subscription (or cooperation from someone that does have that permission, who can run some commands on your behalf).
  - Access to the [Postman REST client](https://www.postman.com/) (either in the browser or downloaded to your local machine). As part of the module, you'll be asked to create a Postman account.
