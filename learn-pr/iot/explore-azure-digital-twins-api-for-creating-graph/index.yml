title: Explore the Azure Digital Twins API for creating a graph
summary: Use the Azure Digital Twins APIs to create models, twins, and relationships; gather information about the elements you created; query the graph; and add endpoints and event routes.
abstract: | 
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to...
  - Set up .http files in Visual Studio that are authorized to send Azure Digital Twins control and data plane API requests.
  - Identify key Azure Digital Twins actions that can be performed with the APIs.
  - Construct Azure Digital Twins API requests for import jobs, models, twins, queries, endpoints, and event routes.
prerequisites: |
  - Beginner level knowledge of HTTP, REST services, and APIs.
  - Understanding of how models, twins, and relationships are used in an Azure Digital Twins solution.
  - An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free), and permission to manage access to Azure resources in the subscription (or cooperation from someone that does have that permission, who can run some commands on your behalf).
  - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/), with the ASP.NET and web development workload installed.
