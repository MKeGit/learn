In this module, you explored the major Azure Digital Twins API operations as part of a solution to digitally represent a city energy grid.

After setting up an `.http` file in Visual Studio, you used the Import Jobs API to populate an Azure Digital Twins graph with models, twins, and relationships to represent city grid entities. You used the Models and Digital Twins APIs to verify and update the graph, and the Query API to further validate and explore it. Finally, you used the Endpoints control plane API and Event Routes data plane API to prepare the graph for IoT data to propagate through it.

With the built-in Azure Digital Twins capabilities for creating models, devices, and connections between them, you were able to create a central destination for device data that's intuitively organized like your real world environment. This can be used to give stakeholders and operators a quick, all-up view of the energy grid components in the city and how they connect to each other. Later, you'll be able to build on this solution by sending IoT data into this graph, in order to gather queryable insights and build dashboards to track what's happening with the city's energy flow in near-real time.

You might also want to delete the resources that you downloaded or created on your machine for this module. This includes the sample graph file that you downloaded in Unit 3 (*distributionGridBulkImport.json*) and your project in Visual Studio. You might choose to remove the Visual Studio application completely, if you downloaded it specifically for this module and don't want to use it again in the future.
