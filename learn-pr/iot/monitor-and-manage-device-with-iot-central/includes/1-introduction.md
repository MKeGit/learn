Azure IoT Central is an IoT application platform as a service (aPaaS) that reduces the burden and cost of developing, managing, and maintaining IoT solutions. Use IoT Central to quickly evaluate your IoT scenario and assess the opportunities it can create for your business.

Suppose you work at a coffee machine company as the IT expert. Your company will launch IoT enabled coffee machines and wants to monitor and manage issues remotely. If the coffee machine is covered by warranty, when the water temperature is outside the expected range the maintenance department needs to be notified for further action. You need a solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor and manage your coffee machines spread around the world.

In this module, you'll connect a coffee machine simulator to IoT Central for monitoring telemetry such as water temperature and humidity, observe the state of the machine, set optimal temperature, receive warranty status, and send commands. You'll then configure rules to send maintenance notifications when the water temperature is outside the expected range.

After you complete this module, you'll be able to create an IoT Central custom application, connect a simulated IoT device, and configure rules for maintenance notifications.
