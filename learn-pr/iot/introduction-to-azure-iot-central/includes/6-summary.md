Our company wanted to maintain pleasant conditions within their stores for the comfort of their customers. It needed a solution to *connect*, *monitor*, and *manage* environmental monitoring devices. We determined that Azure IoT Central could help us quickly evaluate the IoT scenario and assess the opportunities it can create for the company.

To help guide the decision, we applied the criteria **experience** and **customization** on the retail company scenario and concluded that IoT Central accounts for lack of skills and experience, can integrate with custom notification systems, and allow us to build a solid evidence of the business impact with a no-code experience.
