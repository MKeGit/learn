>[!TIP]
>If your data plane bearer token from [Unit 2](../explore-azure-digital-twins-api-for-creating-graph/2-configure-postman-api-collections.yml) has expired, you'll get a *401 Unauthorized* error. Remember that you can re-run the `az account get-access-token --resource 0b07f429-9f4b-4714-9392-cc5e8e80c8b0` command to get a new token, and update it in the **Authorization** tab of your data plane Postman collection.
