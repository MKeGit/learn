.NET MAUI provides a way to create cross-platform apps that can run on Windows, Android, macOS, and iOS devices.

In this module, you:

- Learned the basic architecture of .NET MAUI.
- Created .NET MAUI app.
- Defined a shared UI for the platforms supported by .NET MAUI.
- Deployed a .NET MAUI app from Visual Studio.
- Used .NET MAUI to access platform APIs.

You built a .NET MAUI app that runs on Windows and Android. You also used .NET MAUI APIs to access the phone dialer on both platforms. This app acts as the proof-of-concept for the requirement defined in the introduction. Specifically, you set out to create an app that:

- Runs on Windows, Android, and other supported devices.
- Minimizes development time.
- Can access the phone dialer.
