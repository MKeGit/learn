It's difficult to design a user interface that looks the same across devices. Each device could have a different form factor, size, and pixel density. You'd need to write more code to make sure your app looks great on all devices.

.NET MAUI provides layout panels to help solve this problem. With `StackLayout`, `VerticalStackLayout`, `HorizontalStackLayout`, and `Grid`, you have extensive control over the arrangement of your views. Using the layout strategies that you learned here, you can develop apps that adapt to all your user's many devices.
