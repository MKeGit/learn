Stacking views in a vertical or horizontal list is a common design for user interfaces. Think about some common pages in applications. Examples include sign in, register, and settings pages. All these pages typically contain stacked content. In this unit, you learn how to arrange views in a vertical or horizontal list by using `StackLayout` and the optimized StackLayout controls `VerticalStackLayout` and `HorizontalStackLayout`.

## What is a StackLayout, VerticalStackLayout, and HorizontalStackLayout?

`StackLayout` is a layout container that organizes its child views left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The direction is based on its `Orientation` property, and the default value is top-to-bottom. The following illustration shows a conceptual view of a vertical `StackLayout`.

- `StackLayout` has a list of `Children` that it inherits from its base class `Layout<T>`. The list stores views, which is helpful because most UI elements you work with in .NET MAUI derive from `View`. Layout panels also derive from `View`, which means you can nest panels if you need to.

- `VerticalStackLayout` and `HorizontalStackLayout` are the preferred layouts to use when you know that your orientation isn't going to change, because they're optimized for performance.

## How to add views to a StackLayout

In .NET MAUI, you can add views to a `StackLayout` in C# code or in XAML. Here's an example of three views added using code:

```xaml
<StackLayout x:Name="stack">
</StackLayout>
```

```csharp
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        var a = new BoxView { Color = Colors.Silver, HeightRequest = 40 };
        var b = new BoxView { Color = Colors.Blue, HeightRequest = 40 };
        var c = new BoxView { Color = Colors.Gray, HeightRequest = 40 };

        stack.Children.Add(a);
        stack.Children.Add(b);
        stack.Children.Add(c);
    }
}
```

You can add the views to the `Children` collection and `StackLayout` automatically positions the views in a vertical list. Here's what it looks like on an Android device:

To do the same thing in XAML, nest the children inside the `StackLayout` tags. The XAML parser adds the nested views to the `Children` collection automatically because `Children` is the `ContentProperty` for all layout panels. Here's an example of the same three views being added to a `StackLayout` in XAML:

```xaml
<StackLayout>
    <BoxView Color="Silver" HeightRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Blue" HeightRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Gray" HeightRequest="40" />
</StackLayout>
```

## How views are ordered in a StackLayout

The order of the views in the `Children` collection determines their layout order when they're rendered. For views added in XAML, the textual order is used. For children added in code, the order in which you call the `Add` method determines the layout order.

## How to change the space between views in a StackLayout

It's common to want some space between the children of a `StackLayout`. `StackLayout` lets you control the space between each child by using the `Spacing` property. The default value is zero units, but you can set it to whatever looks good to you. Here's an example of setting the `Spacing` property to `30` in XAML:

```xaml
<StackLayout Spacing="30">
    <BoxView Color="Silver" HeightRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Blue" HeightRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Gray" HeightRequest="40" />
</StackLayout>
```

The following screenshot shows how the UI would render on Android:

## How to set the orientation of a StackLayout

`StackLayout` lets you arrange children in either a column or a row. You control this behavior by setting its `Orientation` property. So far, we've been showing only a vertical `StackLayout`.

`Vertical` is the default. Whether you explicitly set the `Orientation` to `Vertical` is up to you. Some programmers prefer an explicit setting to make the code more self-documenting.

Here's an example of setting the `Orientation` to `Horizontal` in XAML:

```xaml
<StackLayout x:Name="stack" Orientation="Horizontal">
    <BoxView Color="Silver" WidthRequest="40"/>
    <BoxView Color="Blue" WidthRequest="40"/>
    <BoxView Color="Gray" WidthRequest="40"/>
</StackLayout>
```

> [!NOTE]
> As described in the previous exercise, the change in orientation of the `StackPanel` causes it to ignore the `HeightRequest` properties of each `BoxView`. Instead, you set the `WidthRequest`.

## Set a view's LayoutOptions in a StackLayout

Every view has a `VerticalOptions` and `HorizontalOptions` property. You can use these properties to set the position of the view within the rectangular display area provided by the layout panel.

As noted previously, with `StackLayout`, the behavior of the `LayoutOptions` properties depends on the `Orientation` property of the `StackLayout`. `StackLayout` uses the `LayoutOptions` property in the direction opposite to its `Orientation`. By default, an element in a stack layout isn't allocated any extra space in the same direction as the `Orientation` of the stack layout. Assigning a position for that direction in this default case doesn't change the rendering of the element. There's a change in the rendering, though, when position is combined with expansion.

## What about expansion?

Recall from an earlier unit that the `LayoutOptions` struct contains a `bool` property called `Expands` that is now obsolete in .NET MAUI. When you set the `VerticalOptions` and `HorizontalOptions`, you might notice the `LayoutOptions` of `StartAndExpand`, `CenterAndExpand`, `EndAndExpand`, and `FillAndExpand`. If you set `LayoutOptions` to one of these `AndExpand` options, the option is ignored and the first part of the `LayoutOptions` is used such as `Start`, `Center`, `End`, or `Fill`. If you're migrating from Xamarin.Forms, you should remove all `AndExpand` from these properties. Later in the module, we see how to achieve similar functionality when we learn about `Grid`.

## Optimized StackLayouts

As mentioned earlier, the `VerticalStackLayout` and `HorizontalStackLayout` are optimized `StackLayout` controls with predefined orientations. We recommended that you use these controls when possible, for the best layout performance. These layouts have the functionality of `LayoutOptions` and `Spacing` that the regular `StackLayout` has.

```xaml
<VerticalStackLayout Spacing="30">
    <BoxView Color="Silver" HeightRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Blue" HeightRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Gray" HeightRequest="40"/>
</VerticalStackLayout>

<HorizontalStackLayout Spacing="30">
    <BoxView Color="Silver" WidthRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Blue" WidthRequest="40" />
    <BoxView Color="Gray" WidthRequest="40" />
</HorizontalStackLayout>
```
