Storing data locally on a mobile device can be useful for improving performance. Instead of constantly making calls to a remote server to get data, you can store the important data locally and retrieve it quickly.

Depending on the type of data you have, there are different storage options available. When you're working with data that's relational in nature, a database is the best option.

You can create a local database in a .NET MAUI app by using SQLite. SQLite-net is a C# wrapper around SQLite. SQLite exposes an asynchronous API to help ensure that the application's UI always remains responsive.

In this module, you learned how to store data locally in a .NET MAUI app. Specifically, you learned about:

- The different data storage options that are available for .NET MAUI applications.
- Storing relational data in a SQLite database.
- Interacting with a database asynchronously to make sure that your UI remains responsive.
