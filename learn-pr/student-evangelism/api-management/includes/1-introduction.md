Web APIs are great because they allow you to expose your services to the world for many clients to consume. These clients could live both within your company and externally. However, as these APIs grow in number, you need to manage them, secure them, and monitor them.

There are many ways to manage APIs. You could opt for a securing these APIs one by one, which could make sense from a cost perspective, but it could be a nightmare to manage. You could also opt for a centralized API management solution, one that's configuration driven, and that allows you to manage all your APIs in one place. This situation is where Azure API Management comes in. 

Also, as generative AI becomes more popular, you might want to use it in your business. However, as you bring these APIs online, you need to manage them with and consider aspects like security, monitoring, for example,  token usage and handling loads and failures.
