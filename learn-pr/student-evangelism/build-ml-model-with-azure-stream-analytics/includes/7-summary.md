In this module, you built a polar bear tracking solution that uploads images from a simulated array of cameras to Azure Blob Storage. The polar bear tracking solution uses Azure Functions to trigger a function app each time an image is uploaded. Then, it analyzes the images for polar bears by using the Azure AI Custom Vision service. Next, polar bear data is read to a SQL database that you created by using Azure SQL Database. Finally, the database output is visualized in a customizable Power BI report. It's a sophisticated solution, and one that has applications in the real world.
