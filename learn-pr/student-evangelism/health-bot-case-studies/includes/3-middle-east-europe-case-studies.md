Azure Health Bot empowers healthcare organizations to build and deploy an AI-powered, compliant, conversational healthcare experiences at scale. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the service helped several nations in the Middle East and Europe to give people access to trusted and relevant healthcare services and information. Let's look at some use cases.

## HUS in Finland

Helsinki University Hospital (HUS), the largest healthcare provider in Finland, serves more than half a million patients annually. As part of its Virtual Health Village initiative, HUS used Azure Health Bot to create bots to help patients with acne, varicose veins, and social issues.

## Ministry of Public Health in Lebanon 

The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) in Lebanon created a COVID-19 health bot based on Azure Health Bot. It was developed by trakMD, along with the Epidemiological Surveillance and E-Health teams of MoPH, in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO).  

The bot has a symptom checker that simulates six scenarios, so users can take self-assessments to screen for potential infections. The bot can also identify high-risk patients aligned with medical procedures, and then direct those patients for further consultation and treatment in hospital facilities.

## Daman in the United Arab Emirates

Daman, the leading health insurance company in the United Arab Emirates, collaborated with Microsoft to deploy the Daman Health Bot. This AI-powered tool helps patients conduct self-assessments on COVID-19 symptoms and then guides patients to the appropriate level of care.

The Daman Health Bot is bilingual. It asks a defined set of questions and follows specific protocols in providing patient assessment, triage, and symptom checking. From there, it offers medical information and makes medical recommendations. For example, it advises patients to connect with the Abu Dhabi Department of Health, the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Health and Prevention, and the Dubai Health Authority for further assistance.

## East Limburg Hospital in Belgium

East Limburg Hospital (ZOL) in Genk, Belgium, used Azure Health Bot to create a chat bot for patient health. It's based on a questionnaire that determines the likelihood that a patient is infected with the COVID-19 virus.

The bot helps the hospital to properly assess a potential new outbreak and take the necessary precautions. Each questionnaire is linked to a patient file, so the hospital can determine how many patients are in each postal code. 

The hospital uses a color-coding system of green, yellow, and orange to identify low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk patients. The hospital can then separate these patients to reduce the risk of infection. This system helps ensure that patients can get their necessary treatments in an environment that's safer for them and for medical staff.
