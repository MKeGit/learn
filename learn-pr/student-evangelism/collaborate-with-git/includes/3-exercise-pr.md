In the sandbox, make sure you’re still in the *Alice* directory, which is the top folder for Alice’s clone of the Cats repo. You can use the command `pwd` to verify your folder location.

```bash
pwd

```

Right now, there's nothing for Alice to pull because you haven't made any changes since Alice cloned the repo. You can prove that by using the following command, which shows the output `Already up to date`:

```bash
git pull

```

## Make a change and submit a pull request

Alice starts working on the website. Alice's first decision is to change the site's background color. Alice experiments locally and ultimately chooses their favorite shade of light blue.

1. Set up an identity for Alice by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    git config user.name "Alice"
    git config user.email "alice@contoso.com"

    ```

    These `config` settings are stored in the repo in the *.git/config* file, so you won't have to enter them again. Each time you change to the *Alice* directory, you effectively assume Alice's identity.

1. Open the *site.css* file in the *Alice/CSS* directory:

    ```bash
    code CSS/site.css

    ```

1. To change the background color of the page to light blue, replace the second line in the file with the following statement:

    ```css
    body { font-family: serif; background-color: #F0FFF8; }
    ```

    Then, save the file and close the editor.

1. Now, commit the change:

    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "Change background color to light blue"

    ```

1. Then, make a pull request back to the original repo:

    ```bash
    git request-pull -p origin/main .

    ```

1. Check the output. You should see output similar to the following example:

    ```output

## Create a remote and complete the pull request

Because your project directory and the *Alice* directory are on the same computer, you can pull directly from the *Alice* directory. In real life, the *Alice* directory would be on Alice's computer. You solve this situation by setting up a *remote* by using the `git remote` command. Then, you use that remote for pull and push requests. For this exercise, it's not practical to set up two machines to do these steps, so we'll set up a remote that uses a local path name. In reality, you would use a network path or URL instead.

1. Change back to the project directory and use the `git remote` command to create a remote named `remote-alice` that targets Alice's project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../Cats
    git remote add remote-alice ../Alice

    ```

1. Now, execute a pull:

    ```bash
    git pull remote-alice main

    ```

    Notice that you have to specify a branch, `main`, in the pull command. You will learn in the next lesson how to set up an upstream URL for the branch.

1. Check the output. You should see output like this example, which shows that you successfully completed the pull request:

    ```output
    remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    remote: Total 4 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    From ../Alice
     * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
     * [new branch]      main     -> remote-alice/main
    Updating 2bf69ab..95bbc3b
    Fast-forward
     CSS/site.css | 2 +-
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
    ```

The fun is just beginning! In the next lesson, you learn how to set up and use a shared repository, which makes collaborating simpler and more convenient.
