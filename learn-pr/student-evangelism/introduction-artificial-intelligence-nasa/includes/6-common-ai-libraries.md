Later in this learning path, we'll use three Python libraries:

- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- PyTorch

The libraries are free and are commonly used in real-life AI projects.

## Matplotlib

The Matplotlib library is primarily used to visualize data in Python. You can use Matplotlib to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is useful for displaying your data in a more visual way.

## NumPy

The NumPy library, short for *Numerical Python*, is a popular option that's used to organize and store data in Python. You can use NumPy to create structures to hold sets of data called *arrays*. Like lists, arrays store many types of data. NumPy has many functions that are helpful for manipulating data in arrays.

## PyTorch

The PyTorch library is a machine-learning library. It has many built-in functions to help accelerate building projects. PyTorch primarily is used to modify data in an existing machine-learning program.

## Other libraries

There are many other libraries you can use to create an AI model.
