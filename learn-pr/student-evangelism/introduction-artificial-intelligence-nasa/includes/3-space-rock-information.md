Let's start by learning about the different types of space rocks we'll be studying. You'll get a chance to see how well *you* do at classifying Moon rocks.

## Moon rocks: Dissect the Moon

In this lesson, we'll use two types to classify rocks: *basalt* and *highland* (also known as *crustal*). Both of these rock types are found on Earth. But for our study, we'll look only at the lunar variants; that is, rocks from the Moon.

### Basalt rock: Dig into a Moon crater

Basalt is a dark rock. Scientists believe basalt comes from ancient volcanic eruptions on Earth's Moon. When you look up at the Moon and see dark spots and patches, you're likely seeing basalt rock. Nearly 17% of the near side of the Moon is basalt, and only 2% of the far side is basalt. Most basalt in both of the Moon's hemispheres is found in basins or large craters.

### Highland rock: Brush the Moon's crust

Highland rock is lighter than basalt rock, because basalt is made of heavier elements like iron and magnesium. A theory about how highland rock was made is that a large magma ocean covered the Moon as it formed, then crystallized. The theory is the highland rock floated to the top of the ocean and became the crust of the Moon.

## Exercise: Classify a Moon rock

Take a careful look at the sample images for the different rock types shown in this unit. Do you think you could classify a new rock that astronauts recently gathered from the Moon?

Did you notice it can be difficult to classify this rock because it looks like *both* highland rock and basalt rock?

This exercise shows how artificial intelligence can assist humans in their research. Computers are great at finding the smaller details that the human eye can easily miss.
