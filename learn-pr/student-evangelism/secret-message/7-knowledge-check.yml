  title: "Answer the following questions to see what you've learned."
  questions:
  
  - content: "ASCII is a way to represent what characters as numbers?"
    choices:
    - content: "English letters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. English letters are represented as numbers in ASCII, but they aren't the only characters that are represented as numbers."
    - content: "Numbers 0-9"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Numbers 0-9 are represented as numbers in ASCII, but they aren't the only characters that are."
    - content: "Punctuation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Punctuation is represented as numbers in ASCII, but they aren't the only characters that are represented as numbers."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "English letters, numbers 0-9, and punctuation are all represented as numbers in ASCII."
  
  - content: "If you call your `lasso_letter()` function and pass in `p` as the `letter` parameter and `-2` as the `shift_amount` parameter, what letter is returned?"
    choices:  
    - content: "`Error`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The code you wrote works with any whole number. If you pass in a negative number, the decoder function parses the word backwards."
    - content: "`o`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For a return value of `o`, you would pass in a `shift_amount` value of `-1`."
    - content: "`n`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The code you wrote takes the ASCII number value of `p` and adds `-2` to it, which basically subtracts 2!"
    - content: "`P`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The code you wrote doesn't convert a lowercase letter to uppercase."
  
  - content: "The secret location and date to find the hidden treasure is when and where?"
    choices:  
    - content: "June 22nd in Seattle"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check your code again and make sure you put in your secret message correctly!"
    - content: "January 8th in Montevideo"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check your code again and make sure you put in your secret message correctly!"
    - content: "October 30th in London"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check your code again and make sure you put in your secret message correctly!"
    - content: "April 4th in Contosoville"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! When you decipher the secret message by using your code, you get the answer `april fourth contosoville`."
