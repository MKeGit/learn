With your <b>decrypt.py</b> file, you can now decode any secret message that uses the English alphabet. Your decoded messages will be in all lowercase, but that shouldn't take away from the meaning behind them.

## Other challenges for your decrypt code

As an added challenge, you can explore how to:

- Maintain casing for each letter throughout the decoding process.
- Create a function to read in an entire message without having to print each word individually.
- Modify your decoder to include numbers.

## Discover the next coding challenge

Now that you've decoded your first secret message, the natural next step is to determine what your super sleuth character is! In the next module in this learning path, you'll create a test to determine your superpower with Python and Visual Studio Code.
