  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What would the following code return: `'1' == 1`?"
      choices:
        - content: "true"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Using the == operator would return true, because it's an
            implicit check.
        - content: "false"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Using the == operator wouldn't return false, because it
            isn't an explicit check.
        - content: "null"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This code would return a true or false.
    - content: "What would the following code return: `'1' === 1`?"
      choices:
        - content: "true"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The === operator compares strict equality.
        - content: "false"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. We're comparing strict equality.
        - content: "null"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This code would return a true or false.
    - content: Choose the correct operator to express 'or' logic.
      choices:
        - content: a | b
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A logical OR is needed.
        - content: a || b
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A logical OR compares two Boolean expressions.
        - content: a or b
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A logical OR is needed to compare two Boolean expressions.
