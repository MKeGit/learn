In this module, our production supervisor originally needed to detect appliances with manufacturing defects visually. However, production needed to be ramped up significantly, and existing (manual) methods would no longer work. Further, the company wanted to deploy the solution rapidly and the technology team was well versed in development but not in operations. 

To solve this business problem, Azure Functions was used for connecting IoT devices to the Azure AI services. Azure Functions allowed the company to scale the solution up or down without deploying infrastructure in advance. Because IoT solutions are event-based, the functionality provided by Triggers and Bindings enabled the company to develop IoT solutions rapidly.  

Without the ability to deploy Azure functions using IoT devices, the company would need to plan the infrastructure in advance. They would also need to invest in expensive resources for deployment of solutions. The availability of using Azure Functions with IoT devices helped the company to save costs, scale solutions, and deploy solutions rapidly.
