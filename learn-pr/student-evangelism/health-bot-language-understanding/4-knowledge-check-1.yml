    # Question 1
    - content: "Sarah has been having severe pain in her lower back recently and has also been experiencing frequent headaches. She decides to consult an app which uses the Azure Health Bot to find out the root cause. Which of the following models would be best suited to handle this situation?"
      choices:
        - content: "RegEx"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: 'Incorrect. RegEx models are used to understand simple and predictable commands from users like "I need help!"'
        - content: "LUIS"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Although you can train a LUIS model to do this, it might not be the best way to handle medical complaints."
        - content: "System models"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. The built-in medical models provide Language Understanding that's tuned for medical concepts and clinical terminology."
    
    # Question 2
    - content: "While ______ are required, _____ are optional."
      choices:
        - content: "intents, entities"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "Correct. You need to provide intents to your LUIS app to be able to understand the user's utterance. Entities help you extract meaningful data from the utterance, but they're optional for your LUIS app."
        - content: "entities, intents"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Intents are required when you create your LUIS app."
        - content: "utterances, intents"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "Incorrect. Sample utterances and intents are required when you create your LUIS app."
