PyBryt is an open-source Python library for providing specific feedback to students while they work through an assignment without an instructors intervention. It's an automated framework that assesses a student's solution to a problem and determines its correctness. The PyBryt framework provides targeted messages to the student about specific implementation details, by comparing a solution to one or more reference implementations provided by the instructor. In this way, students can get the same helpful hints and pointers automatically, without having to meet with an instructor.

This module is a follow-up to the [Introduction to PyBryt](/training/modules/introduction-pybryt/) module and covers more advanced subjects that build on the information presented in the first module.

## What are you going to learn?

In this module, you learn about options for configuring annotations, combining annotations with relational annotations, and checking the time complexity of student code. You also learn about how PyBryt can be incorporated in a grading pipeline.

## What is the main goal?

By the end of this module, you should be able to write reference implementations that implement complex logic for assessing student submissions, and understand how to build out a pipeline for grading submissions.
