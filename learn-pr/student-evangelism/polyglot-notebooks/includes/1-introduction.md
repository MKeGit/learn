Documenting a system is key to be able to work with it efficiently. There are different ways to document though from specific API docs, written documentation describing the system, UML, and even tests can be considered part of the documentation. Systems change though, so documentation needs to change with it. Good documentation should also include code that shows how to work with various parts of the system.

Scenario: Building a living documentation for my development team 

You're part of a development team; you build and maintain many different codebases from backend to frontend and even a mobile app project. You often switch between projects to address a bug or to build a new feature. To make both onboarding easier and "context switching," you want to find a way to document your systems, so it becomes easier to maintain them.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain why you should use Polyglot Notebooks.
- Create and run Notebooks. 
- Use features like variable sharing and commands to combine frontend and backend and mermaid to render flowcharts and diagrams. 

## Learning objectives

By completing this module, you learn to document your IT systems not only with static text but also with code that you can run to create "living documentation".

## Prerequisites

To get started with Polyglot Notebooks, you need to:
 
- Install the latest .NET SDK,
- Install Polyglot Notebooks as an extension on Visual Studio Code. From there, you can create and run Notebooks and do much more.
