Your challenge was to build a web application that integrates computer vision capabilities, leveraging Azure AI Vision and Azure OpenAI cognitive services. You were asked to use the newest Image Analysis 4.0 features - powered by Microsoftâ€™s Florence large foundation model - to analyze an existing image and enrich your solution with generative AI capabilities to generate a new one from a text description.
