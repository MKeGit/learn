In this module, we looked at cloud computing and Azure as well as tools and learning platforms that can help you as a student. 

- Azure is a cloud platform by Microsoft where you can host your apps but also integrate with a multitude of APIs, giving your apps added capabilities like AI. By using Azure, there are many concerns you no longer need to manage compared to hosting your apps locally, or _on-premises_. Some concerns Azure handles for you are scaling, backup, and analytics.
- GitHub is a hosted platform where you can use the code revision tool Git. By using GitHub, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Codespaces you can collaborate on projects as a student, get suggestions on how to write code, and even run your code in the cloud.
- Visual Studio Code is an integrated development environment (IDE). What makes Visual Studio Code a great tool to use is that itâ€™s free, it integrates well with Git and GitHub, and it offers a large ecosystem of extensions enhancing its capabilities. With Visual Studio Code, you can complete work faster and with fewer errors.
- We also looked at Microsoft Learn, a free platform containing more than 3000 modules that teach a wide variety of skills pertaining to Azure, Microsoft tools, app building, data science, AI, and much more. The Microsoft Learn gamified interface gives you points upon completing modules, encourages you to gather trophies and allows you to track progress and achievements, making learning fun and engaging.
