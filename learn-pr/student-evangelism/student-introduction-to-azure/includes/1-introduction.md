As a student, you might be interested in learning how to get started with cloud computing by using Microsoft Azure to help you solve technical problems. Azure offers a range of features that make it an attractive option, including automated backup, seamless scaling, and the ability to easily integrate AI into your apps.

When it comes to app development, whether it be in the field of data science, web development, or any other domain, you'll be faced with several challenges. One such challenge is ensuring that your app reaches a wide audience while maintaining optimal performance, regardless of whether it's serving a few users or millions.

Additionally, you want best-in-class security and you also want to be able to monitor the health of your app. You can solve all of these challenges with your own _on-premises_ servers and your own software, but itâ€™s costly and takes many people to manage. By using cloud platforms like Azure, you can address most of these issues so you can focus your efforts on developing new features instead of spending time on configuration or other concerns. In this module, we'll explore Microsoft Azure and gain a high-level understanding of its capabilities.

## Scenario: Evaluate Azure for a university project

As a student on cloud course, you've been tasked with evaluating how you can build an app that can meet a set of requirements like scaling to serve thousands of users in multiple regions, that can handle backup, and much more. You're now in a position where you need to find out more about the cloud, cloud computing and other connected terms to help you build apps that can reliably serve a large customer base. Additionally, you'll explore other tools and platforms that can help in your learning journey.

## What will I learn?

In this module, you'll learn to:

- Distinguish core concepts of cloud computing.
- Understand what Azure can be used for by exploring some common scenarios.
- Identify some tools and services that can help you get started with Azure.

## What is the main objective?

This module helps you understand some core concepts of cloud computing, Azure, and what to use it for.
