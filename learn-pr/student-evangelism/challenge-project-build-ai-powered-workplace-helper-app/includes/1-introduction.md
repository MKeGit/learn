Solving real-world problems with Power Platform is a great way to demonstrate your understanding of problem specifications and your ability to create tangible solutions to those problems. 

In this module, you'll build a workplace helper app, combining Power Apps and use Copilot Studio. The solution will use Generative AI and topic-based answers to help the employees of an organization quickly access company policies, procedures, websites, and relevant emergency information.

## About the challenge

Large organizations have a lot of information and documents, such as workplace policies and procedures, plans for emergencies, or general business information. With so much information, employees might struggle to quickly find the answers to their questions.

In this module, you'll build a Power App that leverages a chatbot you built in Copilot Studio to answer employee questions. You'll provide organizational data for your chatbot to ingest in the form of PDF files and websites to allow it to generate answers and links with an AI solution based on organizational knowledge. Your app will also include specified answers for dealing with emergency situations in the local area and AI-generated answers.

By the end of this module, you'll have an app that responds to employees when they ask it to help them find the specific information they need.
