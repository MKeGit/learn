In this activity, you'll create a Copilot with generative answers. You'll provide the AI knowledge in the form of PDF documents and/or website addresses.

You can complete this exercise either for the fictitious Contoso company or for an organization you're a part of and can access information and documents for. If you choose your organization, include an emergency evacuation document to complete the module as it's written.

## Specifications

Create a new Copilot in [Copilot Studio](https://web.powerva.microsoft.com/) within an environment hosted in the United States.

Configure your Copilot as follows:

- Enable generative answers in the **Settings** > **AI Capabilities** menu.
- Train the Generative AI model by providing company information in the form of PDFs or other text-based files.
- If you're completing this exercise for your own organization, you can add further training data by providing web addresses.

> [!NOTE]
> To create the chatbot for the Contoso example, you can download the [example PDFs here](https://aka.ms/helper-app-demo-texts) to use as your organizational knowledge resources.
