In this exercise, you'll create a GitHub account, create a repository, and create a local copy of the repository on your machine. This unit will set you up nicely for a future exercise where you'll modify your repository files. 

## Create a GitHub account

First, you need an account with GitHub. The following steps guide you in setting up an account.

1. Visit the GitHub website at https://github.com and sign up for a new account.
2. Provide the necessary information, including your username, email address, and password. You might need to verify your email address to create your personal account.
3. Take a moment to customize your profile by adding a profile picture and a brief bio by adding a README file.  

Example of a GitHub profile:

## Create a repository

To start creating a repository and explore the options for public and private repositories on GitHub:

1. Sign in to GitHub, if youâ€™re not signed in already.

1. Go to your dashboard and select the plus ("+") icon in the upper-right corner.

1. Select **New repository** from the dropdown menu.

1. Choose a descriptive name for your repository that reflects the project it represents.

1. Determine the visibility of your repository: whether it should be public (visible to anyone) or private (with restricted access for specific collaborators).

1. Optionally, add a description to provide an overview of your project, its purpose, and its key features. Consider adjusting other repository settings based on your requirements, such as including a README file or adding a license.

## Clone a repository

We'll need to clone the repository to make sure we can make changes to it using our local machine.

1. On the main page of your GitHub repository, select the green **Code** button.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/fork-step-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to locate the code button on your new repository's homepage.":::

1. Copy the repository's URL provided in the dropdown menu. You'll use it later to create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/fork-step-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to copy the repository URL to your clipboard.":::

1. Open a terminal or Git Bash on your local machine and go to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

1. Use the command `git clone <repository URL>` to clone the repository to your local machine. For example: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`

Congratulations! You created a GitHub account, set up your profile, created a repository, and cloned the new repository to your local machine. This workflow establishes a solid foundation for collaborating and sharing code effectively using Git and GitHub.
