  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: What part of a `for` loop would you need to modify to increment its iteration by 5?
      choices:
        - content: The condition
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A condition states whether the loop should continue to iterate.
        - content: The counter
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A counter keeps track of the current index.
            iteration.
        - content: The increment expression
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. An increment expression states how much to increase the counter.
    - content: What's the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop?
      choices:
        - content: A `for` loop has a counter, a condition, and an increment expression, and a `while` loop has only a condition.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. `for` loops and `while` loops differ in the ways they can be used.
        - content: A `while` loop has a counter and an increment expression, and a `for` loop has only a condition.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. This is not how `for` loops and `while` loops operate.
        - content: They are the same, just aliases for each other.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. A `for` loop has a counter, a condition, and an increment expression, and a `while` loop has only a condition.
    - content: Given the code for (let i=1; i < 5; i++), how many iterations will it
        perform?
      choices:
        - content: "5"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The code will iterate as long the variable is less than 5.
        - content: "4"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The code will iterate 4 times, starting at 1 as long as i
            is less than 5.
        - content: "0"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. The code will iterate as long the variable is less than 5.
