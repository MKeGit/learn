  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the following statements is true about branches in Git?'
    choices:
    - content: "Work done on a branch doesn't interfere with work in other branches."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The purpose of branches is to isolate changes in one branch from changes made in another branch, until you're ready to merge the changes in both branches together."
    - content: "A branch can't have any other branches that extend from its line of development."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The purpose of branches is to be able to isolate some changes from other changes in the same project. Git supports the ability to add as many branches and sub-branches as your project requires."            
    - content: "The default branch in a Git repo is named `master` and this branch name can never be changed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By default, Git names the default branch `master`, but you can rename this branch as you would any other branch." 
  
  - content: 'Which of the following Git commands creates a new branch, and then changes your working location to the new branch?'
    choices:
    - content: "`git branch my-new-branch` <br /> `git checkout my-new-branch` <br />"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You can also use the command `git checkout -b my-new-branch` to create and switch to the branch in a single step." 
    - content: "`git branch -new my-new-branch` <br /> `git checkout my-new-branch` <br />"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Review the parameters for the `git branch` command."
    - content: "`git branch -new my-new-branch` <br /> `git switch my-new-branch` <br />"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Review the parameters for the `git branch` command. The command `git switch` is valid, although we didn't review it in this module. You can learn more about the [git switch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-switch) command in the Git documentation."

  - content: 'Suppose you try to merge changes from your local branch into the project repo, but Git returns a merge conflict error. What command can you use to restore the default (`main`) branch to its correct state?'
    choices:    
    - content: "`git merge --cancel` <br />"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The flag `cancel` is not a recognized parameter for the `git merge` command."
    - content: "`git merge --abort` <br />"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This command restores the default (`main`) branch to the state it was in before you tried to merge your changes." 
    - content: "`git merge --reset` <br />"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The command `git reset` is valid, but this form isn't correct. The correct form of the command is `git reset --hard`."

  - content: 'Which of the following samples is an accurate view of what Git might show for a merge conflict between the `my-penguins` branch and the `main` branch?'
    choices:
    - content: ":::code source=\"./resources/quiz-sample-1.html\" range=\"1-8\" highlight=\"3,7\":::"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Take a closer look at the other samples. Something is missing in this sample."    
    - content: ":::code source=\"./resources/quiz-sample-2.html\" range=\"1-11\" highlight=\"4,7,9\":::"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Check the location of the content that has conflicts. Git should show the incoming changes above the separator and the existing content in the `main` branch below the line."
    - content: ":::code source=\"./resources/quiz-sample-3.html\" range=\"1-11\" highlight=\"4,6,9\":::"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Git always shows you the entire file. Git uses left and right angle brackets to surround the sections of content that have a conflict. Git uses a line of equal signs to separate two versions of content that are in conflict."
