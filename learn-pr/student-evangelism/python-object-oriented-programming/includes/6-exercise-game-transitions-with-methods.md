Now that you've added classes and data to your rock, paper, scissors game, it's time to add the last part, which is behavior. You'll add behavior in the form of methods. You'll add methods to your classes, and the end result will be a working game of rock, paper, scissors.

## Implement behavior

You've been taught that to build a program in object-oriented programming (OOP) style, first you model, then you code. The modeling produced the output of a table representing what objects, data, and behavior your program seems to consist of. Here's that same table again.

|Phase     | Actor             |Behavior                                 | Data                                            |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Input     | Participant       | Chooses symbol                          | Symbol saved as _choice_ on Participant(choice)  |
|Processing| GameRound         | Compares choices against game rules     | _Result_ inspected                              |
|Processing| GameRound         | Awards points based on result value     | _Points_ added to winning Participant(point)    |
|Processing| Game              | Check continue answer                   | Answer is true, continue, else quit             |
|Output    | Game              | New game round or game end credit       |                                                 |

This time, you'll focus on the `Behavior` column and populate it with methods that will be added to your classes. Additionally, you'll add code to those methods so they work the way they should.

Here's your code so far. Let's extend it in the following steps:

1. You should have a file `rock-paper-scissor.py`. If not, then take the following steps:
1. In the Cloud Shell window on the right side of the screen, select the **More** icon (**...**), then select **Settings** > **Go to Classic version**.
1. Create the file `rock-paper-scissor` and open the editor:

   ```bash
   touch rock-paper-scissor.py
   code .
   ```

   and add the below code:

   ```python
   class Participant:
       def __init__(self):
           self.points = 0
           self.choice = ""
    
   class GameRound:
    
   class Game:
       def __init__(self):
           self.endGame = False
           self.participant = Participant()
           self.secondParticipant = Participant()
   ```

### Start a game

The first part of the game involves setting it up, which means to instantiate the game itself and take the game to a point where it's waiting for the participants to act.

1. Replace the content of `rock-paper-scissor.py` with this code and save the file:

    ```python
    class Participant:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
            self.points = 0
            self.choice = ""
        def choose(self):
            self.choice = input("{name}, select rock, paper or scissor: ".format(name= self.name))
            print("{name} selects {choice}".format(name=self.name, choice = self.choice))
    
    class GameRound:
        def __init__(self, p1, p2):
            p1.choose()
            p2.choose()
        def compareChoices(self):
            print("implement")
        def awardPoints(self):
            print("implement")
    
    class Game:
        def __init__(self):
            self.endGame = False
            self.participant = Participant("Spock")
            self.secondParticipant = Participant("Kirk")
        def start(self):
            game_round = GameRound(self.participant, self.secondParticipant)
    
        def checkEndCondition(self):
            print("implement")
        def determineWinner(self):
            print("implement")
    
    game = Game()
    game.start()
    ```

    You've added the methods from your table to each object. The changes you've made can be expressed by a table so it's easier to see what behavior led to what method being added.

    |Behavior              |Method              | Actor       |
    |----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
    |Chooses symbol        | choose()           | Participant |
    |Compares choices      | compareChoices()   | GameRound   |
    |Awards points         | awardPoints()      | GameRound   |  
    |Check continue answer | checkEndCondition()| Game        |
    |Game end credit       | determineWinner()  | Game        |

    Most of the behavior in the preceding table corresponds to methods with similar names. The exception is *Game end credit*, which becomes `determineWinner()`. The reason is that as part of ending a game, it's nice if you can check who won and print out that information. It's up to you if you want to name this method something else.

1. Run the code by invoking `python3`:

   ```bash
   python3 rock-paper-scissor.py
   ```

   The program produces an output like so:

   ```output
   Spock, select rock, paper or scissor:
   ```

   That output means the program is waiting for you to act.

1. Ensure the program works by selecting `rock` and then selecting **Enter**. Select `paper`, and select **Enter** again:

   Your output resembles this text:

   ```output
   Spock, select rock, paper or scissor: rock
   Spock selects rock
   Kirk, select rock, paper or scissor: paper
   Kirk selects paper
   ```

### Implement rules

From the problem description, you read that certain choices beat other choices. For example, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and so on. It's tempting to write code that looks like so:

```python
if choice1 == "rock" and choice2 == "scissor":
    return 1
elif choice1 == "paper" and choice2 == "scissor":
    return -1
else:
    # something else

# and so on
```

It results in a substantial amount of code written and becomes a bit unwieldy. What if the game needs to expand its rule set, which might make the code even harder to maintain?

Fortunately, there's a better way. A better approach is to think about the rules as a matrix. The idea of using a matrix is to express what combination wins over other combinations. A winning move gets a `1`, a draw gets a `0`, and a losing move gets a `-1`. The following matrix is for rock, paper, scissors:

|Choice   |Rock     |Paper    |Scissors  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Rock     | 0       | -1      |  1      |
|Paper    | 1       |  0      | -1      |
|Scissor  | -1      |  1      |  0      |

You can implement the preceding table in Python by using a multidimensional array, like so:

```python
rules = [
    [0, -1, 1],
    [1, 0, -1],
    [-1, 1, 0]
]

rules[0][1] # Rock vs Paper = -1, Paper wins over Rock
```

1. Locate the `Participant` class and add the method `toNumericalChoice()`:

   ```python
       def toNumericalChoice(self):
           switcher = {
               "rock": 0,
               "paper": 1,
               "scissor": 2
           }
           return switcher[self.choice]
   ```

   The preceding method will convert your command-line string input to an integer. It will make it easier to determine who won a round.

   > [!TIP]
   > Be sure to position your cursor to indent the code correctly.

1. Locate the `GameRound` class, and update the `compareChoices()` method:

   ```python
       def compareChoices(self, p1, p2):
           return self.rules[p1.toNumericalChoice()][p2.toNumericalChoice()]
   ```

   The code will enable you to compare two choices and determine the winner.

1. In the same class, add the method `getResultAsString()`:

   ```python
       def getResultAsString(self, result):
           res = {
               0: "draw",
               1: "win",
               -1: "loss"
           }       
           return res[result]
   ```

   This method will help determine the result and print an easy-to-understand text to the screen.

1. Still in the same class, replace the contents of `__init__()` with this code:

   ```python
       def __init__(self, p1, p2):
           self.rules = [
               [0, -1, 1],
               [1, 0, -1],
               [-1, 1, 0]
           ]

           p1.choose()
           p2.choose()
           result = self.compareChoices(p1,p2)
           print("Round resulted in a {result}".format(result = self.getResultAsString(result) ))
   ```

   The preceding code introduces the field `rules`, which contains an implementation of the rules for rock, paper, scissors. Additionally, the call to `self.compareChoices()` _compares_ the two choices made. Lastly, there's a row that prints reader-friendly results to the screen.

### Score the game

Scoring the game is about assigning points to the correct player after play has ended. The winning player gets one point, a draw, or no points in the case of a loss.

1. Locate the `Participant` class, and add the method `incrementPoint()`:

   ```python
       def incrementPoint(self):
           self.points += 1
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Introducing a method to change an attribute is the first step toward encapsulation. If you want, try changing the `points` field to `__points__` to *hide* the member from the outside to practice encapsulation.

1. Locate the `GameRound` class, and add the following code to the end of the `__init()__` method:

   ```python
           if result > 0:
              p1.incrementPoint()
           elif result < 0:
              p2.incrementPoint()
   ```

### Add a continuation query

A continuation query is a question at the end of the game round asking the player if they want to continue. If the user chooses not to continue, it can output the current results and the winner, if any.

1. Locate the `Game` class, and update the method `determineWinner()`:

   ```python
       def determineWinner(self):
           resultString = "It's a Draw"
           if self.participant.points > self.secondParticipant.points:
               resultString = "Winner is {name}".format(name=self.participant.name)
           elif self.participant.points < self.secondParticipant.points:
               resultString = "Winner is {name}".format(name=self.secondParticipant.name)
           print(resultString)
   ```

1. In the same class, update the method `checkEndCondition()`:

   ```python
       def checkEndCondition(self):
           answer = input("Continue game y/n: ")
           if answer == 'y':
               GameRound(self.participant, self.secondParticipant)
               self.checkEndCondition()
           else:
               print("Game ended, {p1name} has {p1points}, and {p2name} has {p2points}".format(p1name = self.participant.name, p1points= self.participant.points, p2name=self.secondParticipant.name, p2points=self.secondParticipant.points))
               self.determineWinner()
               self.endGame = True
   ```

1. In the same class, replace the code for the `start()` method with this code:

   ```python
       def start(self):
           while not self.endGame:
               GameRound(self.participant, self.secondParticipant)
               self.checkEndCondition()
   ```

1. Save the file.

1. Run the command `python3 rock-paper-scissor.py` to test out your program:

   ```bash
   python3 rock-paper-scissor.py
   ```

   Select `rock` and `paper` as inputs, and enter `n` when you're asked to continue.

   Your output looks similar to the following text:

   ```output
   Spock, select rock, paper or scissor: rock
   Spock selects rock
   Kirk, select rock, paper or scissor: paper
   Kirk selects paper
   Round resulted in a loss
   Continue game y/n: n
   Game ended, Spock has 0, and Kirk has 1
   Winner is Kirk
   ```

Congratulations, you did it! You've implemented an OOP version of the game rock, paper, scissors.
