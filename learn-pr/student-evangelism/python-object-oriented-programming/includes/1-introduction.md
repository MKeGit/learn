Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm you can use to model the real world in code. There are several benefits to using this paradigm. With OOP, you can create implementations that are easy to modify and extend with less code.

As part of a development team, you'll write code that solves small problems along with large and more intricate problems. OOP is one programming paradigm out of many, but it does have some interesting constructs and principles that will help frame your thinking.

In this module, you will evaluate OOP by applying it on a small and defined problem &mdash; a game of rock, paper, scissors &mdash; to see if it's a fit for you and your team.
