In this module, you learned the core concepts of building websites in Python by using the Flask framework. Typically, the core of a Flask application is **app.py**, and the code calls Flask functions such as `render_template()`. You also learned how to programmatically inject content into HTML templates by using Jinja, and how to use `@app.route()` to connect functions in your code to routes that the application supports. 

Also, you discovered that you can use Azure AI services to build intelligent applications infused with AI. By using the Translator service, you were able to translate text by using a few lines of code rather than by creating your own machine learning model. Combined with other services in Azure AI services, these APIs make it possible to write apps that you could have only dreamed about a few years ago.
