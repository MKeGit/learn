Finally, it's time to test your model with data that was never found in your dataset.

On July 30, 2020, NASA launched the Perseverance rover to Mars from Cape Canaveral at 7:50 AM Eastern Time.

Gather the input data for the model:

- Crewed or Uncrewed
- High Temp
- Low Temp
- Ave Temp
- Temp at Launch Time
- Hist High Temp
- Hist Low Temp
- Hist Ave Temp
- Precipitation at Launch Time
- Hist Ave Precipitation
- Wind Direction
- Max Wind Speed
- Visibility
- Wind Speed at Launch Time
- Hist Ave Max Wind Speed
- Hist Ave Visibility
- Condition

You can find this information on most weather sites. Remember the data should be all numerical.

The following example uses hypothetical data:

```python
# ['Crewed or Uncrewed', 'High Temp', 'Low Temp', 'Ave Temp',
#        'Temp at Launch Time', 'Hist High Temp', 'Hist Low Temp',
#        'Hist Ave Temp', 'Precipitation at Launch Time',
#        'Hist Ave Precipitation', 'Wind Direction', 'Max Wind Speed',
#        'Visibility', 'Wind Speed at Launch Time', 'Hist Ave Max Wind Speed',
#        'Hist Ave Visibility', 'Condition']

data_input = [ 1.  , 75.  , 68.  , 71.  ,  0.  , 75.  , 55.  , 65.  ,  0.  , 0.08,  0.  , 16.  , 15.  ,  0.  ,  0. ]

tree_model.predict([data_input])
```

## Continue to improve

As you continue to improve your model in ways described throughout this learning path, keep an eye out on other [NASA rocket launches](https://www.nasa.gov/event-type/launch-schedule/?azure-portal=true). See if your model can accurately predict the outcomes.

You can also use weather predictions combined with your machine-learning model to see if you can predict if there's a delay even before the launches happen!
