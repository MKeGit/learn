  questions:
    
    - content: "What's the main difference between an interrupting scenario and a breaking scenario?"
      choices:
        - content: "They're almost the same. We get the same results."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: They're not the same. One of them returns to the original bot, whereas the other doesn't.
        - content: "A breaking scenario breaks from the current flow and returns, whereas an interrupting scenario doesn't return."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: A breaking scenario doesn't return to the original bot.
        - content: "An interrupting scenario breaks from the current flow and returns, whereas a breaking scenario doesn't return."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: An interrupting scenario returns to the main scenario with an interrupt message, whereas a breaking scenario doesn't. A breaking scenario breaks the flow.
    
    - content: "How does an interrupting scenario work?"
      choices:
        - content: "When the user finishes running a bot, the interrupting scenario takes the user to the interrupting bot."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "An interrupting scenario breaks the current flow of the scenario."
        - content: "When the user enters a keyword as the input, the interrupt scenario takes the user to the interrupting bot."
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The keyword is important for the interrupting scenario. The whole interruption is possible only because of this keyword. This is defined while you're creating a new model."
        - content: "When the user interrupts the present bot by selecting **Stop**, the interrupt scenario takes the user to the interrupting bot."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "There is no option for the user to select **Stop** while the bot is running. Ending the current flow of the bot doesn't take the user to the interrupting bot."
        

    - content: "Which of the following needs to be unique?"
      choices:
        - content: "Returning message"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The returning message can be the same for more than one scenario."
        - content: "Description"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: "The description of one scenario can be same as the description of another scenario."
        - content: "Scenario ID"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: "The scenario ID is unique to every scenario. This is necessary to map the scenario."
