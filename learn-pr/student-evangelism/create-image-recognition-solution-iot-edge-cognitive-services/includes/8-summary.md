Consider the example of the self-cashouts that use Azure AI services and IoT Edge to recognize fruit images and covert the name of the fruit to the speech. 

Custom Vision service let you build a pretrained model and export it for offline use. Speech service let you convert the text into the speech and IoT Edge can enable you to run modules securely on edge devices. 

Imagine how you could build all the functionality from scratch such us security or deploying machine learning models at the edge for faster inferencing.By using IoT Edge, you can expose functionality of IoT Hub for device authentication and communication and you can run the modules as Docker container independently.
