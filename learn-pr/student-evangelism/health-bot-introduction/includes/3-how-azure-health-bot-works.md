The Azure Health Bot service simplifies the process of creating a bot that addresses the compliance and regulatory requirements of the healthcare industry. It does so by providing the following capabilities:

### Extensible management portal

Each Health Bot instance is managed and monitored via the Health Bot service's management portal and management API. The management portal lets you define the Health Bot instance's behavior in fine detail and to monitor usage with built-in reports. You can use the management API to embed the Health Bot instances and to securely exchange data and information.

You can use the flexibility of the service as shown in the following examples:

- Author unique scenarios for your Health Bot instance to extend the baseline scenarios and support your own flows.
- Configure the Health Bot instance's behavior to match your scenarios.
- Connect the Health Bot instance to other information systems, like those that manage EMR, health information, and customer information.
- Integrate the Health Bot instance into other systems such as websites, chat channels, and digital personal assistants.

### Integration with other Azure AI services

Health Bot implements natural language processing (NLP) and AI technologies to understand users' intent and provide accurate information. Users interact with the chat bot via text or voice in a self-service manner. The next module of the learning path explains more about these interactions.

### Built-in triage and symptom checker

The interactive symptom checker and medical database built in to Health Bot enable meaningful conversations with patients by using both common language and medical terms. Conversational intelligence adapts dynamically as the Health Bot instance learns from previous interactions. Azure AI services and credible world knowledge provide the service's intelligence.

### Healthcare-specific configuration options

Health Bot is designed to meet the regulatory requirements of the healthcare industry, so it's important mention the issues of trust and compliance. The information that each instance of the Health Bot Service handles is privacy protected to HIPAA standards. HIPAA mandates industry-wide standards for healthcare information on electronic billing and other processes. HIPAA also requires the protection and confidential handling of protected health information.
