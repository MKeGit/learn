Your goal was to demonstrate the ability to develop the logic of a console minigame in Python using GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. You needed to understand the configuration of a GitHub Codespaces environment, how to use GitHub Copilot, and how to create methods in Python.

By creating the repetition structure, you created a loop that allows the user to play several times and, from the validation methods, determine who was the winner of the game.

Your ability to implement features of this console minigame application based on a design specification demonstrates your ability to create and call methods. You also demonstrated your ability to use GitHub Copilot as a code assistant.
