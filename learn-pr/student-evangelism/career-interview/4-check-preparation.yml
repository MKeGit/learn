          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Although design patterns are an important part of coding, there's a better option.
        - content: Do a so-called "code kata."
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. Code katas are a good way to practice common
            problems. Some of the katas are even algorithmic in nature. But there's a better
            option.
        - content: Practice problems on a platform like Topcoder.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. A platform like Topcoder or Project Euler enables you to practice specific
            algorithmic problems and analyzes your solution's quality.
