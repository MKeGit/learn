  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: In JavaScript, we can declare values with the keyword _______ or _______
      choices:
        - content: "`let` or `var`"
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! These are the keywords that we need to create and declare
            variables.
        - content: "`get` or `script`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: These keywords won't allow you to create a variable.
        - content: "`char` or `log`"
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: These keywords won't allow you to create a variable.
    - content: Constants are the same as `let` and `var` to declare variables, except that...
      choices:
        - content: Constants can be altered.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The reference of a constant can't be changed after it's initialized, or an error will occur when you're running code.
        - content: Constants must be initialized.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct! Constants must be initialized, or an error will occur when you're running code.
        - content: Constants can be reassigned.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: A constant means the reference is protected from reassignment. The value is not immutable, though. It can change, especially if it's a complex construct like an object.
