With your <b>quiz.py</b> file, you can now truly know who your friends and family are. Well, kind of. :)

Special thanks to [Audrey St. John from Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/directory/faculty-staff/audrey-st-john), who inspired this lesson from the "active learning module" developed by Emily Craig and Sarah Robinson for the [MaGE](https://sites.google.com/mtholyoke.edu/mage-training-curriculum) inclusive peer mentoring program at Mount Holyoke College.

## More challenges for your code

As an added challenge, you can start exploring how you might:

- Reduce the number of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in your code.
- Allow users to select a new choice if they didn't enter **A** or **B**.

## Dive deeper into Python
