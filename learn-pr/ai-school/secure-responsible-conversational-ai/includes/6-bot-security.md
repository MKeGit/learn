Data and security breaches are all too common, and this creates huge problems for technology users. A security breach can often directly result in further problems for users, like identity theft. Severe consequences besides loss of trust can follow from security breaches, no matter the cause — and this is particularly true when those who were meant to be safeguarding the data are found to have been negligent in their duty of care. 

Users have every right to expect that their data is handled securely by your bot. As such, the success of your bot depends on deserving to keep your user's trust.

## Designing for security

Consider security a key feature of your bot’s design. Create a threat model for your system, to identify attack vectors and simulate responses.

Consider using the [Microsoft Threat Model Tool](/azure/security/azure-security-threat-modeling-tool-getting-started "Microsoft Threat Model Tool") to aid in developing this for your bot.

When it comes to cybersecurity, the best offense is often to have nothing, or very little, to defend. When you’re taking or storing user information, design your system to store only key information to reduce the risk from attack. 

## Establish secure development and operations foundations

Working within the framework of established secure software development principles is vitally important. As with any AI system, your bot should ensure proper authentication, separation of duty, input validation, and mitigations for denial-of-service attacks. If available, work with the appropriate security team within your organization to conduct a security review on your bot and supporting services. Given the close relationship of security and privacy in this space, a joint security/privacy review is recommended to ensure the best depth and breadth of coverage.

## Implement systems to detect abnormal behaviors, and prevent manipulation

Semi-autonomous systems can identify users that deviate from norms, including bots that exhibit behavior that might indicate they’re a non-human actor. These might include strange activity patterns like responding too fast, or being active at unusual times, or triggering parts of your application in a way that normal users don’t.

## Ensure the integrity of your training data

This step is particularly important for systems that employ automatic, or unsupervised, training techniques. If your system can’t distinguish between maliciously introduced data and rare but valid data, your bot has a serious problem.

### Data sources

Neural models for conversational AI typically need to be trained on a dataset of around 5 million conversations. Common data sources include:

* Hand-written rules
* Existing conversational data (whether large-scale or small-scale)
* New online conversations.
Naturally occurring conversational data is hard to obtain, for reasons of privacy. However, conversations on public social media sites (for example, from X and Reddit) are one common source of training data. Bear in mind that conversational types vary by the social mediums they appear in - for instance, X conversations tend to be conversation-like and interactive; Reddit exchanges are more like a roundtable where individuals contribute a statement to a discussion.

Sources that are intrinsically private in nature, such as customer and service interaction data, may come under significant restrictions. They’ll require anonymization, and may only be subject to machine learning under eyes-off processes that don’t include personal information.

### Cleaning training data

No matter where your training data is sourced from, it will need to be cleaned before it’s usable. This helps make sure that it conforms to social norms, is grammatically correct, that it conforms to the persona required for your chatbot, and that it doesn’t include personal or identifying information. Special attention should go towards removing or completely anonymize personal information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, zip codes. If this isn’t done, sensitive data like bank account numbers and social security numbers may end up being transmitted naively or maliciously in open conversations. Developers should always consider the possibility that machine learned generative models are capable of accidentally exposing such information given the right inputs.

Although social media is notoriously noisy, extended conversations tend to be relatively clean. Once the data is scrubbed, it can produce models that usually conform to social norms. However, to protect against bad inputs, your training data should include and allow for malformed utterances - spelling mistakes, emotional outbursts, and the like.

Bear in mind that potentially offensive terms have different meanings depending on context. This means that using text-matching methods for identifying text to be deleted must be done carefully. For instance, if you don’t want to talk about “weed”, you could potentially flag this word for deletion, but if your chatbot is for a gardening business you’ll probably want “weed” to stay in!

It’s not a good idea to remove all offensive material from training data. In fact, you’ll actually need to train your model on what to do with offensive inputs and how to handle them appropriately. This means that targeted outputs should be what’s moderated to conform with community standards. But, as mentioned, it’s not enough just to block individual words. In AI, the Jurassic Park principle (“Life finds a way”) always applies. Blocking the word “hate” to avoid generating “I hate \[ethnic group]” may result in the model surfacing the semantically similar “I am not a fan of \[ethnic group]” instead.

In summary - until models can be fully grounded in an understanding of their social environments, it’s probably inevitable that malicious adversaries will continue to probe the boundaries of chatbot deployments. To stay one step ahead, you should ensure that you secure the data necessary to anticipate and thwart such attacks.
