With modern software development tools, it's easier than ever to develop conversational AI bots. Get the most out of your efforts when working with AI by returning to the guidelines we have covered. Remember to:

1. Make sure you understand why your bot exists.
2. Make sure your users know they’re working with a bot.
3. Make sure your bot can ask a human for help.
4. Make sure your bot isn’t accidentally evil - and make doubly sure that users can’t make it evil.
5. Make sure your bot works, and that it will keep working.
6. Make sure your bot can be used by the widest range of people possible.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Identify the different types of conversational AI bots and common stakeholders
* Articulate the benefits of making bots transparent and trustworthy
* Discover guidelines to ensure bots are reliable and accessible

Read Lili Cheng's publication [Responsible Bots: Ten Guidelines for Developers of conversational AI](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/responsible-bots/).

Check out [Microsoft Inclusive Design toolkit](https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/0/d/b0d4bf87-09ce-4417-8f28-d60703d672ed/inclusive_toolkit_manual_final.pdf) to learn how to design bots that recognize exclusion, learn from diversity, and solve for ability constraints.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [guidelines for web accessibility testing](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Accessibility_testing "W3C Accessibility Testing"), will help your bot be accessible to the widest possible audience.

You can implement traceability using [Azure Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview "Azure Application Insights").

Azure AI services like [Text Analytics](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-design-pattern-handoff-human?view=azure-bot-service-4.0 "Text Analytics") and [Content Moderator](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/content-moderator/ "Content Moderator") can help gauge a user’s sentiment, feedback, and identify human handoff points.
