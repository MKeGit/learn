*Object detection* is a form of machine learning based computer vision in which a model is trained to recognize individual types of objects in an image, and to identify their location in the image.

## Uses of object detection

Some sample applications of object detection include:
- **Checking for building safety**: Evaluating the safety of a building by analyzing footage of its interior for fire extinguishers or other emergency equipment.
- **Driving assistance**: Creating software for self-driving cars or vehicles with *lane assist* capabilities. The software can detect whether there is a car in another lane, and whether the driver's car is within its own lanes.
- **Detecting tumors**: Medical imaging such as an MRI or x-rays that can detect known objects for medical diagnosis.
