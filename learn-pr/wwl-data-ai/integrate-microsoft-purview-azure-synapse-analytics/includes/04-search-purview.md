After connecting an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace to a Microsoft Purview account, you can search the Purview catalog from Synapse Studio. This ability to discover and examine data assets from across the enterprise can greatly assist data engineers, data analysts, and other consumers of data by providing a curated catalog of documented data sources for analysis and reporting.

## Search the Purview catalog in Synapse Studio

You can search the catalog from a connected Purview account by using the **Search** bar in the **Data**, **Develop**, or **Integrate** pages in Synapse Studio, as shown here:

The *search results* interface, and the details for each asset found reflect the user interface in the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal, ensuring that the data discovery and examination experience in Synapse Studio is consistent for users of Microsoft Purview in its own portal.
