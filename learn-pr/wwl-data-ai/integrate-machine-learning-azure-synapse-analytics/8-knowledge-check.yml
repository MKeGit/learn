  questions:
  - content: "What compute target is used when AutoML runs through the Spark pool inside Synapse Analytics?"
    choices:
    - content: "Local Compute."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you are not running your experiment on Azure Machine Learning's compute resources, the execution environment is considered local compute."
    - content: "Remote compute."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Remote compute is when training occurs on Machine Learning compute clusters, not in the Spark pool inside Synapse Analytics."
    - content: "Cloud Compute."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There is no such compute target for Azure Machine Learning."
  - content: "What can help to make sure AutoML Models support ONNX format?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define `enable_onnx_compatible_models` as `False` in `AutoMLConfig`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Setting the *enable_onnx_compatible_models* parameter to FALSE will not help to produce an ONNX format model."
    - content: "Enable ONNX model compatibility on the portal during enrichment model configuration."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. ONNX model compatibility will make sure the model supports ONNX."
    - content: "Using Azure Machine Learning workspace instead of the Azure Synapse Workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You can create models from Synapse using data enrichment techniques and enabling ONNX model compatibility on the portal."
  - content: "What is correct about T-SQL PREDICT command?"
    choices:
    - content: "Generates a predicted value or scores based on a stored model within the confines of the data warehouse."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With T-SQL PREDICT, you can bring your existing machine learning models trained with historical data and score them within the secure boundaries of your data warehouse."
    - content: "It does not support ONNX format for models in Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure SQL Edge, and Azure Synapse Analytics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The use of `RUNTIME = ONNX` argument allows T-SQL PREDICT to use ONNX models in Azure SQL Managed Instance, Azure SQL Edge, and Azure Synapse Analytics."
    - content: "Special permissions are required to use the PREDICT command."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No permissions are required for PREDICT; however, the user needs EXECUTE permission on the database and permission to query any data used as inputs. The user must also be able to read the model from a table if the model has been stored in a table."
