In this module, you have learnt about Azure SQL Database, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that offers high scalability and minimal maintenance. The module covered the two primary deployment models: single database and elastic pools, and the various methods of deploying Azure SQL Database. You also learned about the two purchasing models: the vCore model and the DTU-based model. The module further delved into the seamless backup and restore capabilities of Azure SQL Database, its automatic tuning feature, and the functionalities of elastic query, elastic jobs, and SQL Data Sync.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding the Hyperscale service tier in Azure SQL Database, which is a highly scalable storage and compute performance tier ideal for business workloads. It allows databases to exceed 100 TB and offers rapid scale-out by provisioning additional replicas to offload read operations. You also learned about the serverless compute tier for Azure SQL Database, a cost and performance optimized solution that automatically scales compute resources based on workload demand. Lastly, you learned about the use of active geo-replication and auto-failover groups for enhanced availability and disaster recovery, and the role of Microsoft Copilot and LLMs in improving SQL management and building intelligent applications.
