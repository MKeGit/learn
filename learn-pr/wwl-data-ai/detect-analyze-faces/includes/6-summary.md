In this module, we covered facial analysis concepts and Azure AI Face service, which offers pretrained models for face detection, recognition, and analysis. We reviewed capabilities of Face, including the detection of accessories, occlusion, and more. The main takeaways from this module include understanding when to choose Face, and limited access Face features to support Microsoft Responsible AI principles.
