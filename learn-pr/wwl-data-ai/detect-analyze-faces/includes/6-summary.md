While Azure AI Vision and Azure AI Video Indexer offer face detection features, the Face service and associated APIs provide more capabilities. Which you should choose will ultimately depend on the insights you want to gain from facial detection. If you want to look for data around facial landmarks, the Face resource is the best choice.

You can find out more about the Face service in the [service documentation](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-identity).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to decide whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you intend to study other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other exercises.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
