In this module, we covered facial analysis concepts and Azure AI Face service, which offers pre-trained models for face detection, recognition, and analysis. We reviewed capabilities of Azure Face service, including the detection of accessories, blur, exposure, glasses, head pose, mask, noise, occlusion, and quality for recognition. The main takeaways from this module include understanding when to choose Face service versus other services, and which Face features have limited access to support Microsoft Responsible AI principles.
