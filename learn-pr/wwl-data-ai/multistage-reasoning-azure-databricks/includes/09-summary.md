Multi-stage reasoning on Azure Databricks involves breaking down complex analytical tasks into sequential stages, where each stage builds upon the results of the previous one.

Multi-stage reasoning allows you to design modular, scalable workflows that improve the accuracy of generated AI output. In Azure Databricks, you can choose to use a library like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, or DSPy, to build complex AI systems that use multi-stage reasoning.
