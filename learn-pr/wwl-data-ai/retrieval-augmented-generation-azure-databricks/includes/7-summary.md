AutoML can reduce the time and effort required to train effective machine learning models. You can run AutoML experiments interactively in the Azure Databricks portal or in unattended scripts by using the AutoML API. This flexible approach enables you to incorporate AutoML into your machine learning operations solution and optimize model training.
