A vector database is a database that is optimized to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors such as embeddings.
In RAG architecture contextual information is stored in vectors.
Vector databases are designed for efficient storage of vectors utilized in generative AI applications, which rely on identifying documents or images with similarities.
Vector databases provide a query interface that retrieves vectors most similar to a specified query vector.

Specialized, full-fledged databases for unstructured data 
Inherit database properties, i.e. Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD)

Speed up query search for the closest vectors
Uses vector search  algorithms such as Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
Organize embeddings into indices
