Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique in natural language processing that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating vector search mechanisms.

Unlike traditional generative models, which rely solely on pretrained knowledge, RAG dynamically retrieves relevant information from external sources to produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

This hybrid approach uses the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative systems, enabling the generation of highly informative and contextually enriched text. When you combine real-time retrieval with Generative AI, RAG enhances output quality and relevance, making it ideal for applications needing detailed and current information.
