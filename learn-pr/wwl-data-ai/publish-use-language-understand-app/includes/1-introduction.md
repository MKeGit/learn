The Azure AI Language Understanding service enables you to define and train language models that predict a user's *intent* from natural language input. To use this model in an application, you need to publish the Azure AI Language Understanding app for your model and consume it from a client application.

In this module, you'll learn how to publish and use language understanding apps.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Set Azure AI Language Understanding app publishing configuration options.
- Describe Azure AI Language Understanding features.
- Deploy the Azure AI Language Understanding Service as a container.
