# What is Azure AI Content Safety?

Azure AI Content Safety is a set of advanced content moderating features that can be incorporated into your applications and services. Azure AI Content Safety is available as a resource in the Azure portal.

Online content safeguarding is needed in a growing number of situations. Not only are we concerned with moderating content generated by people, but  must also guard against the malicious use of AI.

## Trusting user-generated content

Social interaction is increasingly a part of many digital spaces. Genuine user-generated content is seen as independent and trustworthy, and used alongside advertising and marketing. Different industries are encouraging their customers to connect with each other and their brand.  

Harmful content has many negative affects. It damages trusted brands, discourages users from participating in online forums, and can have a devastating impact on individuals.

Azure AI Content Safety is designed to be used in applications and services to protect against harmful user-generated and AI-generated content.
