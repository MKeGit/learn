The societal implications of AI and the responsibility of organizations to anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of AI technology are significant. Whether through third-party AI solutions or their own, organizations are finding the need to create internal policies and practices to guide their AI efforts. 

Microsoft believes that as organizations and as a society, our steps towards responsible AI need to continually evolve to reflect new innovations and lessons from both our mistakes and accomplishments. The processes, tools, and resources mentioned in these units can be a starting point from which organizations create their own AI strategy.

As the use of AI increases across the private and public sectors, it's essential that we continue to foster open dialogue. Collaboration among businesses, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), academic researchers, and all other interested individuals and organizations allows us to build better solutions. Organizations that embrace AI early have a vital role to play in promoting the responsible use of AI and preparing society for its impacts. Their firsthand experience in dealing with the ethical challenges of AI are crucial knowledge for later adopters and those individuals who are trying to study or regulate AI technology.
