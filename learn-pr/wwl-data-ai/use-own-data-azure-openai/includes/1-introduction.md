Azure OpenAI enables developers to implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by connecting supporting AI chat models to your own data. Those models can reference specific sources of data to ground the response, augmenting the capabilities of the AI model when it creates a response.

In this module, you'll learn how to implement RAG by adding your own data with Azure OpenAI and generate responses based on both your data and the Azure OpenAI pretrained knowledge.
