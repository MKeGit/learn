This module focused on Azure Document Intelligence's prebuilt service, custom service, and its client library SDKs and REST API. We also introduced the Azure Document Intelligence Studio to label and train your model.  

Azure Document Intelligence services can be integrated with other Azure AI Services. For example, you can try using [this tutorial](/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-form) with Azure Document Intelligence and Cognitive Search.  

Document intelligence is just one part of the overall Vision API in Azure AI Services. Azure Document Intelligence services are ever evolving. You can read about the latest updates [here](/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/whats-new).
