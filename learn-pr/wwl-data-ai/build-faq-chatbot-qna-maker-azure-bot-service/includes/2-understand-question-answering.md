**Question answering** supports natural language AI workloads that require an automated conversational element. Typically, question answering is used to build bot applications that respond to customer queries. Question answering capabilities can respond immediately, answer concerns accurately, and interact with users in a natural multi-turned way. Bots can be implemented on a range of platforms, such as a web site or a social media platform. 

Question answering applications provide a friendly way for people to get answers to their questions and allows people to deal with queries at a time that suits them, rather than during office hours. 

In the following example, a chat bot uses natural language and provides options to a customer to best handle their query. The user gets an answer to their question quickly, and only gets passed to a person if their query is more complicated.
