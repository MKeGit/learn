Azure AI Language's custom question answering feature enables you to define and publish a knowledge base of questions and answers with support for natural language querying. When combined with Azure AI Bot Service, you can use a knowledge base to deliver a bot that responds intelligently to user questions over multiple communication channels.

The ability to create conversational AI solutions with these services makes it possible for AI agents to reduce the support workload for human personnel; enabling organizations to provide user support at global scale.

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
