## Real-time hub

The Microsoft Fabric real-time hub acts as a centralized catalog for your organization. It simplifies access, addition, exploration, and data sharing. By broadening data sources, it enhances insights and visual clarity across domains. Crucially, this hub ensures data availability and accessibility, enabling swift decision-making and informed actions. Sharing streaming data from diverse sources unlocks comprehensive business intelligence across your organization.

## Exploring data with real-time intelligence

To explore data with Real-Time Intelligence, initially choose a data stream from your organization or connected external/internal sources and then you can utilize Real-Time Intelligenceâ€™s tools for data exploration and to visualize data patterns, anomalies, and forecasting quantities.

Real-Time dashboards simplify data comprehension, accessible to all via visual tools, Natural Language, and Copilot. You can then turn the insights into actions by setting up Reflex alerts to react in real-time.
