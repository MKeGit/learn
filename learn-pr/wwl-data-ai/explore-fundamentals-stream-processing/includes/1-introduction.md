Increased use of technology by individuals, companies, and other organizations, together with the proliferation of smart devices and Internet access has led to a massive growth in the volume of data that can be generated, captured, and analyzed. Much of this data can be processed in real-time (or at least, *near* real-time) as a perpetual *stream* of data, enabling the creation of systems that reveal instant insights and trends, or take immediate responsive action to events as they occur.

> [!NOTE]
> This module is designed to present a conceptual overview of real-time processing and describe Azure services that can be used to build real-time analytics solutions. It is not intended to teach implementation details for creating a stream processing solution.
