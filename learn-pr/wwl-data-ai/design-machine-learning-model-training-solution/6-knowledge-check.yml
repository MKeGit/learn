  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist wants to train a machine learning model to predict the sales of supermarket items to adjust the supply to the projected demand. What type of machine learning task will the model perform?"
    choices:
    - content: "Classification."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With classification the target value has two or more classes or categories."
    - content: "Regression"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Regression predicts a numerical value."
    - content: "Time-series forecasting"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Time-series forecasting is used to predict future sales."
  - content: "The data scientist received data to train a model to predict the sales of supermarket items. The data scientist wants to quickly iterate over several featurization and algorithm options by only providing the data and editing some configurations. Which tool would best be used in this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Designer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though the Designer can be used to quickly create models, it requires you to decide what components to use and has no built-in component to train a time-series forecasting model."
    - content: "Automated Machine Learning"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You'll only have to provide the data and Automated Machine Learning will iterate over different featurization approaches and algorithms."
    - content: "Azure AI Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AI Services doesn't provide an API to customize a time-series forecasting model."
