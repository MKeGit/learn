You work as a database developer for the AdventureWorks organization. AdventureWorks has sold bicycles and bicycle parts directly to end-consumers and distributors for over a decade. Their systems store information in a database that you previously migrated to Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

After performing the migration, you want assurance that the system is performing well. You decide to use the Azure tools available to monitor the server. To alleviate the possibility of slow response times caused by contention and latency, you decide to implement read replication. You need to monitor the resulting system and compare the results with the flexible server architecture.

In this exercise, you perform the following tasks:

1. Configure Azure metrics for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL service.
1. Run a sample application that simulates multiple users querying the database.
1. View the metrics.

### Set up the environment

Run these Azure CLI commands in the Cloud Shell to create an Azure database for PostgreSQL, with a copy of the adventureworks database. The last commands print the server name.

```azurecli
SERVERNAME="adventureworks$((10000 + RANDOM % 99999))"
PUBLICIP=$(wget http://ipecho.net/plain -O - -q)
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-070-Migrate-Open-Source-Workloads-to-Azure.git workshop

az postgres server create \
    --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> \
    --name $SERVERNAME \
    --location westus \
    --version 10 \
    --storage-size 5120

az postgres db create \
    --name azureadventureworks \
    --server-name $SERVERNAME \
    --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>

az postgres server firewall-rule create \
    --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> \
    --server $SERVERNAME \
    --name AllowMyIP \
    --start-ip-address $PUBLICIP --end-ip-address $PUBLICIP

PGPASSWORD=Pa55w.rdDemo psql -h $SERVERNAME.postgres.database.azure.com -U awadmin@$SERVERNAME -d postgres -f workshop/migration_samples/setup/postgresql/adventureworks/create_user.sql

PGPASSWORD=Pa55w.rd psql -h $SERVERNAME.postgres.database.azure.com -U azureuser@$SERVERNAME -d azureadventureworks -f workshop/migration_samples/setup/postgresql/adventureworks/adventureworks.sql 2> /dev/null

echo "Your PostgreSQL server name is:\n"
echo $SERVERNAME.postgres.database.azure.com
```

### Configure Azure metrics for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL service

1. Using a web browser, open a new tab and navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true).
1. In the Azure portal, select **All resources**.
1. Select the *Azure Database for PostgreSQL* server name starting with **adventureworks**.
1. Under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics**.
1. On the chart page, add the following metric:

    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Scope | adventureworks[nnn] |
    | Metric Namespace | **PostgreSQL server standard metrics** |
    | Metric | **Active Connections** |
    | Aggregation | **Avg** |

    This metric displays the average number of connections made to the server each minute.

1. Select **Add metric**, and add the following metric:

    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Scope | adventureworks[nnn] |
    | Metric Namespace | **PostgreSQL server standard metrics** |
    | Metric | **CPU percent** |
    | Aggregation | **Avg** |

1. Select **Add metric**, and add the following metric:

    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Scope | adventureworks[nnn] |
    | Metric Namespace | **PostgreSQL server standard metrics** |
    | Metric | **Memory percent** |
    | Aggregation | **Avg** |

1. Select **Add metric**, and add the following metric:

    | Property  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Scope | adventureworks[nnn] |
    | Metric Namespace | **PostgreSQL server standard metrics** |
    | Metric | **IO percent** |
    | Aggregation | **Avg** |

    These final three metrics show how resources are consumed by the test application.

1. Set the time range for the chart to **Last 30 minutes**.
1. Select **Pin to Dashboard**, and then select **Pin**.

### Run a sample application that simulates multiple users querying the database

1. In the Azure portal, on the page for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, under **Settings**, select **Connection Strings**. Copy the ADO.NET connection string to the clipboard.

1. Move to the *~/workshop/migration_samples/code/postgresql/AdventureWorksSoakTest* folder.

    ```bash
    cd ~/workshop/migration_samples/code/postgresql/AdventureWorksSoakTest
    ```

1. Open the App.config file using the code editor:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

1. Replace the value of **Database** with **azureadventureworks**, and replace **ConectionString0** with the connection string from the clipboard. Change the **User Id** to **azureuser@adventureworks[nnn]**, and set the **Password** to **Pa55w.rd**. The completed file should look similar to the following example:

    ```XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
            <add key="ConnectionString0" value="Server=adventureworks101.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=azureadventureworks;Port=5432;User Id=azureuser@adventureworks101;Password=Pa55w.rd;Ssl Mode=Require;" />
            <add key="ConnectionString1" value="INSERT CONNECTION STRING HERE" />
            <add key="ConnectionString2" value="INSERT CONNECTION STRING HERE" />
            <add key="NumClients" value="100" />
            <add key="NumReplicas" value="1"/>
        </appSettings>
    </configuration>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ignore the **ConnectionString1** and **ConnectionString2** settings for now. You'll update these items later in the lab.

1. Save the changes and close the editor.
1. At the Cloud Shell prompt, run the following command to build and run the app:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    When the app starts, it spawns threads, each thread simulating a user. The threads perform a loop, running a series of queries. You'll see messages such as the following messages starting to appear:

    ```sql
    Client 48 : SELECT * FROM purchasing.vendor
    Response time: 630 ms

    Client 48 : SELECT * FROM sales.specialoffer
    Response time: 702 ms

    Client 43 : SELECT * FROM purchasing.vendor
    Response time: 190 ms

    Client 57 : SELECT * FROM sales.salesorderdetail
    Client 68 : SELECT * FROM production.vproductanddescription
    Response time: 51960 ms

    Client 55 : SELECT * FROM production.vproductanddescription
    Response time: 160212 ms

    Client 59 : SELECT * FROM person.person
    Response time: 186026 ms

    Response time: 2191 ms

    Client 37 : SELECT * FROM person.person
    Response time: 168710 ms
    ```

    Leave the app running while you perform the next steps.

### View the metrics

1. Return to the Azure portal.
1. In the left-hand pane, select **Dashboard**.

    You should see the chart displaying the metrics for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL service.

1. Select the chart to open it in the **Metrics** pane.
1. Allow the app to run for several minutes (the longer the better). As time passes, the metrics in the chart should resemble the pattern illustrated in the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-metrics-for-single-server.png" alt-text="Image showing the metrics gathered while the sample app is running":::

    This chart highlights the following points:

    - The CPU is running at full capacity; utilization reaches 100% very quickly.
    - The number of connections slowly rises. The sample application is designed to start 101 clients in quick succession, but the server can only cope with opening a few connections at a time. The number of connections added at each "step" in the chart is getting smaller, and the time between "steps" is increasing. After approximately 45 minutes, the system was only able to establish 70 client connections.
    - Memory utilization is increasing consistently over time.
    - IO utilization is close to zero. All the data required by the client applications is currently cached in memory.
  
    If you leave the application running long enough, you'll see connections starting to fail, with the error messages shown in the following image.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-connection-errors.png"  alt-text="Image showing the connection errors that can occur when the server has insufficient resources available":::

1. In the Cloud Shell, press Enter to stop the application.

### Configure the server to collect query performance data

1. In the Azure portal, on the page for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, under **Settings**, select **Server parameters**.
1. On the **Server parameters** page, set the following parameters to the values specified in the table below.

    | Parameter  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | pg_qs.max_query_text_length | **6000** |
    | pg_qs.query_capture_mode | **ALL** |
    | pg_qs.replace_parameter_placeholders | **ON** |
    | pg_qs.retention_period_in_days | **7** |
    | pg_qs.track_utility | **ON** |
    | pg_stat_statements.track | **ALL** |
    | pgms_wait_sampling.history_period | **100** |
    | pgms_wait_sampling.query_capture_mode | **ALL** |

1. Select **Save**.

### Examine the queries run by the application using Query Store

1. Return to the Cloud Shell, and restart the sample app:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    Allow the app to run for 5 minutes or so before continuing.

1. Leave the app running and switch to the Azure portal
1. On the page for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, under **Intelligent performance**, select **Query Performance Insight**.
1. On the **Query Performance Insight** page, on the **Long running queries** tab, set **Number of Queries** to 10, set **Selected by** to **avg**, and set the **Time period** to **Last 6 hrs**.
1. Above the chart, select **Zoom in** (the magnifying glass icon with the "+" sign) a couple of times, to home in on the latest data.

    Depending on how long you have let the application run, you'll see a chart similar to the following. Query Store aggregates the statistics for queries every 15 minutes, so each bar shows the relative time consumed by each query in each 15-minute period:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-long-running-queries.png" alt-text="Image showing the statistics for long running queries captured by using Query Store":::

1. Hover the mouse over each bar in turn to view the statistics for the queries in that time period. The three queries that the system is spending most of its time performing are:

    ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM sales.salesorderdetail
    SELECT * FROM sales.salesorderheader
    SELECT * FROM person.person
    ```

    This information is useful for an administrator monitoring a system. Having insight into the queries run by users and apps enables you to understand the workloads performed, and possibly make recommendations to application developers on how they can improve their code. For example, is it necessary for an application to retrieve all 121,000+ rows from the **sales.salesorderdetail** table?

### Examine any waits that occur using Query Store

1. Select the **Wait Statistics** tab.
1. Set the **Time period** to **Last 6 hrs**, set **Group By** to **Event**, and set the **Max Number of Groups** to **5**.

    As with the **Long running queries** tab, the data is aggregated every 15 minutes. The table below the chart shows that the system was subject to two types of wait event:

    - **Client: ClientWrite**. This wait event occurs when the server is writing data (results) back to the client. It does **not** indicate waits incurred while writing to the database.
    - **Client: ClientRead**. This wait event occurs when the server is waiting to read data (query requests or other commands) from a client. It is **not** associated with time spent reading from the database.
  
    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-wait-statistics.png" alt-text="Image showing the wait statistics captured by using Query Store":::
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Read and writes to the database are indicated by **IO** events rather than **Client** events. The sample application does not incur any IO waits as all the data it requires is cached in memory after the first read. If the metrics showed that memory was running low, you would likely see IO wait events start to occur.

1. Return to the Cloud Shell, and press Enter to stop the sample application.

### Add replicas to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL service

1. In the Azure portal, on the page for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, under **Settings**, select **Replication**.
1. On the **Replication** page, select **+ Add Replica**.
1. On the **PostgreSQL server** page, in the **Server name** box, type **adventureworks[nnn]-replica1**, and then select **OK**.
1. When the first replica is created (it takea several minutes), repeat the previous step and add another replica named **adventureworks[nnn]-replica2**.
1. Wait until the status of both replicas changes from **Deploying** to **Available** before continuing.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-replicas.png" alt-text="Image showing the Replication page for Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Two replicas have been added.":::

### Configure the replicas to enable client access

1. Select the name of the **adventureworks[nnn]-replica1** replica. You are redirected to the page for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL page for this replica.
1. Under **Settings**, select **Connection security**.
1. On the **Connection security** page, set **Allow access to Azure services** to **ON**, and then select **Save**. This setting enables applications that you run using the Cloud Shell to access the server.
1. When the setting is saved, repeat the previous steps and allow Azure services to access the **adventureworks[nnn]-replica2** replica.

### Restart each server

> [!NOTE]
> Configuring replication does not require you to restart a server. The purpose of this task is to clear memory and any extraneous connections from each server, so that the metrics gathered when running the application again are *clean*.

1. Go to the page for the **adventureworks[nnn]** server.
1. On the **Overview** page, select **Restart**.
1. In the **Restart server** dialog box, select **Yes**.
1. Wait for the server to be restarted before continuing.
1. Following the same procedure, restart the **adventureworks[nnn]-replica1** and **adventureworks[nnn]-replica2** servers.

### Reconfigure the sample application to use the replicas

1. In the Cloud Shell, edit the App.config file.

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

1. Add the connections strings for the **ConnectionString1** and **ConnectionString2** settings. These values should be the same as that of **ConnectionString0**, but with the text **adventureworks[nnn]** replaced with **adventureworks[nnn]-replica1** and **adventureworks[nnn]-replica2** in the **Server** and **User Id** elements.
1. Set the **NumReplicas** setting to **3**.

    The App.config file should now look similar this:

    ```XML<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
            <add key="ConnectionString0" value="Server=adventureworks101.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=azureadventureworks;Port=5432;User Id=azureuser@adventureworks101;Password=Pa55w.rd;Ssl Mode=Require;" />
            <add key="ConnectionString1" value="Server=adventureworks101-replica1.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=azureadventureworks;Port=5432;User Id=azureuser@adventureworks101-replica1;Password=Pa55w.rd;Ssl Mode=Require;" />
            <add key="ConnectionString2" value="Server=adventureworks101-replica2.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=azureadventureworks;Port=5432;User Id=azureuser@adventureworks101-replica2;Password=Pa55w.rd;Ssl Mode=Require;" />
            <add key="NumClients" value="100" />
            <add key="NumReplicas" value="3"/>
        </appSettings>
    </configuration>
    ```

1. Save the file and close the editor.
1. Start the app running again:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    The application runa as before. However, this time, the requests are distributed across the three servers.

1. Allow the app to run for a few minutes before continuing.

### Monitor the app and observe the differences in the performance metrics

1. Leave the app running and return to the Azure portal.
1. In the left-hand pane, select **Dashboard**.
1. Select the chart to open it in the **Metrics** pane.

    Remember that this chart displays the metrics for the adventureworks*[nnn]* server, but not the replicas. The load for each replica should be much the same.

    The example chart illustrates the metrics gathered for the application over a 30 minute period, from startup. The chart shows that CPU utilization was still high, but memory utilization was lower. Additionally, after approximately 25 minutes, the system established connections for over 30 connections. This might not seem a favorable comparison to the previous configuration, which supported 70 connections after 45 minutes. However, the workload was now spread across three servers, which were all performing at the same level, and all 101 connections were established. Furthermore, the system was able to carrying on running without reporting any connection failures.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/6-metrics-for-replicated-server.png" alt-text="Image showing the metrics for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL server while running the application, after replication was configured":::
    
    You can address the issue of CPU utilization by scaling up to a higher pricing tier with more CPU cores. The example system used in this lab runs using the **Basic** pricing tier with 2 cores. Changing to the **General purpose** pricing tier gives you up to 64 cores.

1. Return to the Cloud Shell and press enter, to stop the app.

You've seen how to monitor server activity using the tools available in the Azure portal. You've also learned how to configure replication, and seen how creating read-only replicas can distribute the workload in read-intensive data scenarios.
