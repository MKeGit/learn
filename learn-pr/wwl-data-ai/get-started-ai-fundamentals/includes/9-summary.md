Artificial Intelligence enables the creation of powerful solutions to many kinds of problems. AI systems can exhibit human characteristics to analyze the world around them, make predictions or inferences, and act on them in ways that we could only imagine a short time ago.

With this power, comes responsibility. As developers of AI solutions, we must apply principles that ensure that everyone benefits from AI without disadvantaging any individual or section of society.
