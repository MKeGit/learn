Generative AI (GenAI) is a class of Artificial Intelligence algorithms that learn from existing data and produce new, original content based on natural language input. This module explored the `azure_ai` extension and how it enables you to integrate the natural language processing, content generation, and advanced analytics capabilities of Azure AI and Machine Learning services directly into your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database.

In this module, you:

- Examined the concept of Generative AI language models and explored how they can be used to build rich GenAI applications.
- Evaluated the capabilities of `azure_ai` extension for PostgreSQL.
- Installed and explored the `azure_ai` extension in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database.
