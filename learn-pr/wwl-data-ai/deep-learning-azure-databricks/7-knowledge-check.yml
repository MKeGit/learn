  questions:
  - content: "What does an optimizer do when training a deep learning model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Removes training data for which predictions are incorrect."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Optimizers do not remove data."
    - content: "Adjusts weights and biases to minimize loss."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An optimizer minimizes loss by adjusting weights and biases in the network."
    - content: "Generates predictions from test data to calculate metrics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An optimizer does not test the model."
  - content: "Which method of a PyTorch model class is used to pass data through the network?"
    choices:
    - content: "`backpropagate`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PyTorch models don't use a `backpropagate` method to pass data through the network."
    - content: "`fit`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. PyTorch models don't use a `fit` method to pass data through the network."
    - content: "`forward`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. PyTorch models use a `forward` method to pass data through the network."
  - content: "Which library can you use to distribute PyTorch training across multiple cluster nodes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Horovod"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Horovod library enables distributed deep learning training."
    - content: "Hyperopt"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The hyperopt library is used to optimize hyperparameter values."
    - content: "Scikit-Learn"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Scikit-Learn library provides a framework for classical machine learning."
