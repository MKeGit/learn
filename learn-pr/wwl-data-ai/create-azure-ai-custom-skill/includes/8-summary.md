In this module, you learned how to implement a custom skill for an Azure AI Search solution.

Custom skills can enrich your index in various ways, such as with custom Language models, machine learning, or document intelligence.

Custom skills prevents consumers of your Azure AI Search service from having to do repetitive processing or multiple service calls. This optimization saves both time and cost while delivering a better solution for search.
