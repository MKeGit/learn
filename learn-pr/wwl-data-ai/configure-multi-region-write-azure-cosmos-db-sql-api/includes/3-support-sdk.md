In the .NET SDK for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL, configuring the preferred region to write to be a matter of selecting between two different properties in the **CosmosClientOptions** object.

> [!TIP]
> If you do not specify a preferred region, the SDK will automatically default to the primary region for your account. The primary region is the first region in the region list, and is typically the region you selected first when you created the Azure Cosmos DB account.

## Selecting a single write region

The **ApplicationRegion** property specifies which region you want the SDK to use for its operations. Effectively, this region is the writable region you use. In this example, the selected region is **West US**.

```csharp
CosmosClientOptions options = new()
{
    ApplicationRegion = Regions.WestUS
};

TokenCredential managedIdentityCredential = new ManagedIdentityCredentialBuilder()
    .clientId("<your-managed-identity-client-id>")
    .build();

using CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient("<your-cosmos-endpoint>", managedIdentityCredential, options);
```

You can also use the **CosmosClientBuilder** to configure the preferred region.

```csharp
using CosmosClient client = builder
    .WithApplicationRegion(Regions.WestUS)
    .Build();
```

Once the client connects to Azure Cosmos DB, the client pulls a list of available regions and prioritize them based on proximity from the region you chose. If the region you selected isn't available, the client tries the alternative regions in the established order.

## Building a preferred write regions list

If you want to create your own prioritized list of regions to attempt read and write operations, you can use the **ApplicationPreferredRegions** property. In the first example, this property is set to a list of three regions in a custom prioritization.

```csharp
CosmosClientOptions options = new()
{
    ApplicationPreferredRegions = new List<string>
    {
        Regions.WestUS,
        Regions.AustraliaSoutheast,
        Regions.NorthEurope
    }
};

TokenCredential managedIdentityCredential = new ManagedIdentityCredentialBuilder()
    .clientId("<your-managed-identity-client-id>")
    .build();

using CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient("<your-cosmos-endpoint>", managedIdentityCredential, options);
```

Again, this same example could be implemented using the **CosmosClientBuilder** class.

```csharp
using CosmosClient client = builder
    .WithApplicationPreferredRegions(
        new List<string>
        {
            Regions.WestUS,
            Regions.AustraliaSoutheast,
            Regions.NorthEurope
        }
    )
    .Build();
```
