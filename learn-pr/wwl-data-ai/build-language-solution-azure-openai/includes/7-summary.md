Azure OpenAI offers models for text and embeddings, available through REST API or Python and C# SDKs. This module covered how to use the models in your own application. By using the specific model deployed in your resource, you can utilize Azure OpenAI generative AI models to add intelligence to your application.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Integrate Azure OpenAI into your application
- Differentiate between different endpoints available to your application
- Generate completions to prompts using the REST API and language specific SDKs

For more detail on integrating Azure OpenAI into your application, check out the quickstarts on the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?azure-portal=true) site.
