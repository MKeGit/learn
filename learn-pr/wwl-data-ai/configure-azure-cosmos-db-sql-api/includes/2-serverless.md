Azure Cosmos DB serverless is a consumption-based model where each request consumes request units. The consumption model eliminates the need to pre-provision throughput request units ahead of time.

Remember, when using Azure Cosmos DB, you typically express database options as a cost described in Request Units per second.

Serverless is great for development and testing as well as applications with unpredictable or bursty traffic. You can use serverless with an application such as:

- A new application with hard to forecast users loads
- A new prototype application within your organization
- Serverless compute integration with a service like Azure Functions
- Just getting started with Azure Cosmos DB as a new developer
- Low traffic application that doesnâ€™t send or receive numerous data
