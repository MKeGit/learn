Generative AI is a rapidly developing field of AI that supports new language generation, code development, image creation, and more. This module explored how language models power generative AI and how copilot brings generative AI capabilities to your desktop. You learned the basics of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs), and the underlying transformer architecture of advanced language models.

The main takeaways from this module include understanding the role of generative AI in creating AI assistants or copilots that provide contextualized support for common tasks. Often, generative AI is integrated into chat applications like Microsoft Copilot to interpret natural language inputs and generate suitable responses. You learned about the three levels of copilot adoption and the various applications of Microsoft Copilot across different Microsoft applications. The module also highlighted the importance of improving the quality of responses from generative AI. Finally, you have been introduced to two tools offered by Microsoft for customizing or developing custom copilots: Copilot Studio and Azure AI Studio.
