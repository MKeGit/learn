#### Option 2: Using Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Edge
If you do not have access to Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, launch this version to explore Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Edge. 

This exercise requires a free Microsoft account (for example an *outlook.com*, *live.com*, or *hotmail.com* account), and the Microsoft Edge web browser.

1. If you don't already have Microsoft Edge installed, download and install it for free from [https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download).
1. If you don't already have a Microsoft account, sign up for one at [https://signup.live.com](https://signup.live.com).
1. If you haven't already, sign into Microsoft Edge using your Microsoft account.

> [!TIP]
