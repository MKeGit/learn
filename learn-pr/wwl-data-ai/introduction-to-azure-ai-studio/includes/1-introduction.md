The growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in general, and **generative** AI in particular means that developers are increasingly required to create comprehensive AI solutions. These solutions need to combine machine learning models, AI services, prompt engineering solutions, and custom code.

Microsoft Azure provides multiple services that you can use to create AI solutions. Until now, developers needed to work with multiple tools and web portals in a single project.

The Azure AI Foundry portal brings together capabilities to provide a single, centralized workspace within which developers can collaborate with data scientists and others to build AI solutions.

In this module, you explore the Azure AI Foundry portal and learn how you can use it to create and manage AI development projects.
