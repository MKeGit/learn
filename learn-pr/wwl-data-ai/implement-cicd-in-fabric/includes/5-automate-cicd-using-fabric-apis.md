Fabric REST APIs allow you to automate Fabric procedures and processes, improving efficiency and productivity. REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Programming Application Interface. Azure REST APIs are used to manage and interact with various Azure services. 

Some of the advantages of using the Fabric REST APIs are:
 
- Automating repeat processes with consistency, making it easier to perform data processing on an ongoing basis.
- Seamless integration with other systems and applications, providing a streamlined and efficient data pipeline.

You can use the Fabric CI/CD REST APIs to:

- Commit the changes made in the workspace to the connected remote branch.
- Update the workspace with commits pushed to the connected branch.
- See which items have incoming changes and which items have changes that weren't yet committed to Git with the Git status API.
- List Deployment Pipeline Stage Items: Returns the supported items from the workspace assigned to the specified stage of the specified deployment pipeline.
- Deploy Stage Content: Deploys items from the specified stage of the specified deployment pipeline.
