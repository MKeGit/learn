Computer vision is built on the analysis and manipulation of numeric pixel values in images. Machine learning models are trained using a large volume of images to enable common computer vision scenarios, such as image classification, object detection, automated image tagging, optical character recognition, and others

While you *can* create your own machine learning models for computer vision, the Azure AI Vision service provides many pretrained capabilities that you can use to analyze images, including generating a descriptive caption, extracting relevant tags, identifying objects, and others.
