Azure AI Agent Service offers a variety of custom tools that enhance the capabilities and efficiency of your AI agents. These tools allow for scalable interoperability with various applications, making it easier to integrate with existing infrastructure or web services.

## Custom tool options available in Azure AI services

Azure AI services provide several custom tool options, including OpenAPI specified tools, Azure Functions, and function calling. These tools enable seamless integration with external APIs, event-driven applications, and custom functions.

- **OpenAPI specified tools**: These tools allow you to connect your Azure AI Agent to an external API using an OpenAPI 3.0 specification. This provides standardized, automated, and scalable API integrations that enhance the capabilities of your agent. OpenAPI specifications describe HTTP APIs, enabling people to understand how an API works, generate client code, create tests, and apply design standards.
- **Function calling**: Function calling allows you to describe the structure of functions to an agent and return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments. This feature is useful for integrating custom logic and workflows into your AI agents.
- **Azure Functions**: Azure Functions enable you to create intelligent, event-driven applications with minimal overhead. They support triggers and bindings, which simplify how your AI Agents interact with external systems and services. Triggers determine when a function executes, while bindings facilitate streamlined connections to input or output data sources.

## Example use of custom tools with the Azure AI Agent Service

Custom tools within the Azure AI Agent Service enable users to extend the capabilities of AI agents, tailoring them to meet specific business needs. Some example use cases that illustrate the versatility and impact of custom tools include:

### Customer support automation

- **Scenario**: A retail company integrates a custom tool that connects the Azure AI Agent to their customer relationship management (CRM) system.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can retrieve customer order histories, process refunds, and provide real-time updates on shipping statuses.
- **Outcome**: Faster resolution of customer queries, reduced workload for support teams, and improved customer satisfaction.

### Inventory management

- **Scenario**: A manufacturing company develops a custom tool to link the AI agent with their inventory management system.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can check stock levels, predict restocking needs using historical data, and place orders with suppliers automatically.
- **Outcome**: Streamlined inventory processes and optimized supply chain operations.

### Healthcare appointment scheduling

- **Scenario**: A healthcare provider integrates a custom scheduling tool with the AI agent.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can access patient records, suggest available appointment slots, and send reminders to patients.
- **Outcome**: Reduced administrative burden, improved patient experience, and better resource utilization.

### IT Helpdesk support

- **Scenario**: An IT department develops a custom tool to integrate the AI agent with their ticketing and knowledge base systems.
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can troubleshoot common technical issues, escalate complex problems, and track ticket statuses.
- **Outcome**: Faster issue resolution, reduced downtime, and improved employee productivity.

### E-learning and training

- **Scenario**: An educational institution creates a custom tool to connect the AI agent with their learning management system (LMS).
- **Functionality**: The AI agent can recommend courses, track student progress, and answer questions about course content.
- **Outcome**: Enhanced learning experiences, increased student engagement, and streamlined administrative tasks.

These examples demonstrate how custom tools within the Azure AI Agent Service can be used across industries to address unique challenges, drive efficiency, and deliver value.
