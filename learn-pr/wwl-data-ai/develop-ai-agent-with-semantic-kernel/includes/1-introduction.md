AI agents are transforming how applications interact with users and automate tasks. Unlike traditional programs, AI agents use generative AI to interpret data, make decisions, and complete tasks with minimal human intervention. These agents use large language models to streamline complex workflows, making them ideal for automating business processes. Developers can build AI agents using different tools, including the Semantic Kernel SDK. This open-source SDK simplifies the integration of AI models into applications. The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework can help developers quickly build AI-powered assistants capable of understanding and executing tasks using natural language.

Suppose you need to develop an AI agent that automatically formats and emails expense reports for employees. Your AI agent can extract data from submitted expense reports, format them correctly, and send them to the appropriate recipients. To do this, you can use the Semantic Kernel' SDK. The plugins and functions feature allows your AI agent to interact with APIs, retrieve necessary data, and complete tasks.

In this module, you learn about the core features of the Semantic Kernel SDK and the Agent Framework. You also learn how to create your own AI agents and extend their capabilities with plugin functions.

After completing this module, you're now able to:

- Understand the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework
- Build an agent using the Semantic Kernel SDK
- Integrate plugin functions with your AI agent
