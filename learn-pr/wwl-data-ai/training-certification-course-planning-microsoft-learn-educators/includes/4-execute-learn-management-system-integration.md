As you're setting up your class, you'll be assigning your students’ work on [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/learn). Microsoft Learn is a free online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products. 

We recommend students create an account on Microsoft Learn and sign in to keep track of their completions, share accomplishments, and utilize services to integrate with your institution’s learning management system.

Your school or department can use one or more services offered through Microsoft Learn for easier access, a more seamless experience, and deeper integration with your learning management system. For example:
- The Microsoft Learn Catalog API allows you to send a web-based query to Microsoft Learn and receive details about published [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/learn) content. This information can then be displayed through your own site or LMS experience and students can access it when doing an assignment or for you to display it side by side with other content.
- Microsoft Learn Organizational Reporting allows you to pull a report on your students’ progress and completion of [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/learn) content.
