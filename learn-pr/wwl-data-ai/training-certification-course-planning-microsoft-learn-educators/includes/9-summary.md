Your students want more than a diploma, they want real-world skills that make them employable from the outset. Further, employers highly value graduates who have their degree plus an industry- recognized certification. Using the resources available from Microsoft helps you feel confident to teach your students the skills they need to sit for and pass a Microsoft Certification exam. 

Take a practice exam to help increase your chance of passing your certification exam by preparing for the real exam and building your knowledge of exam objectives. 

To prepare you for delivering cutting-edge technical instruction in your classes, we suggest that all faculty members get certified in the content they'll be teaching. Achieving your own certification helps you understand the process your students are going through and gives you first-hand experience with the exam that you're preparing them to take.
