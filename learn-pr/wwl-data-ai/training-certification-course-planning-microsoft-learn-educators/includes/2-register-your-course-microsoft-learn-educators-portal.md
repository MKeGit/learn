As you prepare to teach each course, register your course by filling out the course intake form in the Microsoft Learn for Educators (MSLE) portal. Registering a course and sharing course details allows you to request labs for students which are covered in Learning path 4. 

Registering a course also allows Microsoft to provide you with the most up to date and relevant information about the course. This information includes new resources that are related to the course, like free training, exam preparation sessions, and student offers such as hackathons.
