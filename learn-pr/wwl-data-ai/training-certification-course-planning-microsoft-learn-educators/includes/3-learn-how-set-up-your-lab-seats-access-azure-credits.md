A lab is a multi-objective scenario-based activity typically found at the end of a learning path or course to reinforce student learning. Labs are hosted by a Microsoft authorized lab host, provided to support course delivery, and mapped to the course materials provided through MSLE. Skillable is the Microsoft authorized lab host for the MSLE program.

As an educator, you can request lab seats for your students in the [Microsoft Learn for Educators Portal](https://aka.ms/MSLEPort) when you register your course. 

If your institution is part of the MSLE educational institutional program option, first and foremost, the program advisor at the institution must accept the MSLE program terms. If you're part of the MSLE individual educators program option, you accept lab terms when registering your courses in the course intake form.

Once you submit the course intake form the information is sent to Skillable. Skillable will provision and manage the labs and contact you via email within 48-72 hours with instructions for creating a Skillable account, how to sign in, and purchase lab seats at a discounted rate.

You receive an extra e-mail with the class information and instructions for students to sign in with the training key. When class begins, students should be provided with these instructions and create their training account on the registration page. They'll view and accept the end user license agreement and be taken directly to their class page. All of the required resources are provided within the lab. If the lab requires Azure credits, they'll be provided via Cloud Slice, which is a predeployed and configured Azure resources or Azure Passes to complete the lab steps.
