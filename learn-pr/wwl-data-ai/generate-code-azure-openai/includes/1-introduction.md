The Azure OpenAI service enables you to use large language models (LLMs) to generate content, including programming code. This functionality allows developers to generate and improve existing programming code in various languages to increase efficiency and understanding.

In this module, you'll learn how to use Azure OpenAI to generate code and help various development tasks.
