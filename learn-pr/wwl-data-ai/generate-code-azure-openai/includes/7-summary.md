The Azure OpenAI models can generate code from natural language prompts and existing code, ranging from a simple one-line command to a full application. Azure OpenAI models can translate code from one language to another, help developers understand unknown code, and assist developers in common software development tasks such as writing unit tests, completing partial code, commenting code, and generating documentation.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Use natural language prompts to write code
- Build unit tests and understand complex code with AI models
- Generate comments and documentation for existing code
