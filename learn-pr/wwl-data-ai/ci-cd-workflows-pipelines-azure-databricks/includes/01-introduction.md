As a data engineer, you create pipelines to process data. To help you easily manage and deploy data pipelines, you can implement **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** (**CI/CD**) workflows with **Delta Live Tables** (**DLT**) **pipelines** in Azure Databricks.

With DLT pipelines, you use the collaborative and scalable platform offered by Azure Databricks to build reliable data workflows. CI/CD ensures your code changes are automatically tested and validated before deployment, reducing errors and improving the quality of your data pipelines.

By integrating with version control systems like Git and using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automation, you can achieve continuous delivery. Implementing CI/CD keeps your data pipelines up-to-date and aligned with business needs. It speeds up deployment and promotes best practices like version control, automated testing, and continuous monitoring.
