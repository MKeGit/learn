Implementing CI/CD workflows with Delta Live Tables (DLT) Pipelines in Azure Databricks streamlines the process of managing and deploying data pipelines by automating the integration and delivery of code changes. DLT Pipelines use the power of Databricksâ€™ collaborative and scalable platform, enabling data engineers to build reliable and performant data workflows. With CI/CD, developers can ensure that code changes are automatically tested and validated before being deployed. This automation helps reduce the risk of errors and enhancing the overall quality of the data pipeline. 

Integrating with version control systems like Git, and utilizing Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automation. Development teams can achieve continuous delivery, ensuring that data pipelines are always up-to-date and aligned with the latest business requirements. This approach not only accelerates the deployment process but also promotes best practices in data engineering, such as version control, automated testing, and continuous monitoring.
