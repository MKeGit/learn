Implementing CI/CD workflows with Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipelines in Azure Databricks streamlines the process of managing and deploying data pipelines by automating the integration and delivery of code changes.

DLT Pipelines use the power of Databricksâ€™ collaborative and scalable platform, enabling data engineers to build reliable and performant data workflows. With CI/CD, you can ensure that code changes are automatically tested and validated before being deployed. When you automate your tasks, you reduce the risk of errors and enhance the overall quality of your data pipeline.

By integrating with version control systems like Git, and utilizing Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automation, you can achieve continuous delivery. CI/CD helps ensure that data pipelines are always up-to-date and aligned with the latest business requirements. When you implement CI/CD, you not only accelerate the deployment process but also employ best practices in data engineering, such as version control, automated testing, and continuous monitoring.
