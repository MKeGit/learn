Once the model is deployed, you can test how it completes prompts. A prompt is the text portion of a request that is sent to the deployed model's completions endpoint. Responses are referred to as *completions*, which can come in form of text, code, or other formats. 

## Prompt types

Prompts can be grouped into types of requests based on task.

|Task type| Prompt example | Completion example|
|:--------|:------------------------ |:-------------------------------|
|**Classifying content** | Tweet: I enjoyed the trip. <br/> Sentiment: | Positive|
|**Generating new content** | List ways of traveling|1. Bike <br/> 2. Car ...|
|**Holding a conversation** | A friendly AI assistant |[See examples](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/completions#conversation?portal=true)
|**Transformation** (translation and symbol conversion)| English: Hello <br/> French:|bonjour|
|**Summarizing content**|Provide a summary of the content <br/> {text} |The content shares methods of machine learning.|
|**Picking up where you left off** | One way to grow tomatoes |is to plant seeds.|  
|**Giving factual responses** | How many moons does Earth have? |One|

## Completion quality

Several factors affect the quality of completions you'll get from a generative AI solution.

- The way a prompt is engineered. Learn more about [prompt engineering here](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering?portal=true).
- The model parameters (covered next)
- The data the model is trained on, which can be adapted through [model fine-tuning with customization](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning?pivots=programming-language-studio?portal=true) 

You have more control over the completions returned by training a custom model than through prompt engineering and parameter adjustment.

## Making calls

You can start making calls to your deployed model via the REST API, Python, C#, or from the Studio. If your deployed model has a GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 model base, use the [Chat completions documentation](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference#chat-completions?azure-portal=true), which has different request endpoints and variables required than for other base models.
