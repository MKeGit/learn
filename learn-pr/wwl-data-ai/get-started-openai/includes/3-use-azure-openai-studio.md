Azure AI Studio provides access to model management, deployment, experimentation, customization, and learning resources. 

You can access the Azure AI Studio through the Azure portal after creating a resource, or at [https://ai.azure.com/](https://ai.azure.com/) by signing in to your Azure account. During the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

When you first open Azure AI Studio, you'll want to navigate to the **Azure OpenAI** page, select your resource if you haven't already, and deploy your first model. To do so, select the **Deployments** page, from where you can deploy a base model and start experimenting with it.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are not the resource owner, you will need the following role-based access controls: 1. *Cognitive Services OpenAI User*: This role allows viewing resources and using the chat playground. 2. *Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor*: This role allows the user to create new deployments.
