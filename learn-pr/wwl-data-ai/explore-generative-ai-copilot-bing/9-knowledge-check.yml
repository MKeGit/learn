quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the significance of providing specific details when asking Copilot to suggest a name for the destination?"
    choices:
    - content: "To ensure that the name is long and complex."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal is not to create a long and complex name, but rather a name that accurately reflects the destination's essence."
    - content: "To make sure that the name includes a pun or cultural reference."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a pun or cultural reference could be included, it's not a requirement. The aim is to create a name that captures the destination's essence."
    - content: "To generate a name that accurately captures the essence and feel of the destination."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Providing specific details helps Copilot generate a name that truly represents the destination's essence and evokes the desired feelings."
  - content: "What is the main benefit of using the multimodal capabilities in Copilot?"
    choices:
    - content: "It allows the copilot to understand images shared in the chat."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Multimodal capabilities enable the copilot to interpret and answer questions about images, and provide visual responses."
    - content: "It allows the copilot to search the web for web related content based on the chat history."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This speaks more to the features or benefits of Copilot in."
  - content: "What is the main difference between few-shot prompting and zero-shot prompting in generative AI?"
    choices:
    - content: "Few-shot prompting sends many paragraphs where a zero-shot prompt is just a sentence."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A few-shot prompt has an example in the prompt to guide the desired output, where a zero-shot prompt does not."
    - content: "Few-shot prompting uses examples of the desired output, while zero-shot prompting uses none."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's  correct. A few-shot prompt provides an example."
    - content: "Few shot prompting provides better results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both zero-shot and few-shot prompting can produce good results. Your choice depends on the model, the task, and the prompt."
