Music is a powerful way to set the mood and atmosphere of your destination. It can also express your theme and personality. How about making a playlist that matches your vision? You can use songs from different genres, artists, and languages to craft your own soundtrack. Use  Copilot to create your playlist.

## Ideate
Ask Copilot to create a playlist of 10 songs that would be appropriate for your destination. Add any details or references to help guide Copilot. You're going to format this list as a table.

2. Paste the prompt into the chat.
3. Review the response, and iterate as needed until you're happy with the output.
4. Take a screen capture of the table of songs it gave you, and save that image.
