Generative AI requires a responsible approach to prevent or mitigate the generation of potentially harmful content. You can use the following practical process to apply responsible AI principles for generative AI:

1. Identify potential harms relevant for your solution.
1. Measure the presence of harms when your system is used.
1. Implement mitigation of harmful content generation at multiple levels of your solution.
1. Deploy your solution with adequate plans and preparations for responsible operation.
