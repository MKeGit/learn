In today's data-driven world, extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of information is paramount. Effective summarization techniques can save time and make decision-making faster and more intuitive by transforming raw, unstructured data into actionable knowledge, whether you're dealing with lengthy documents, customer reviews, or conversational data. In this module, you explore how [Azure AI Services](/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services) and the `azure_ai` extension for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server empower you to use Generative AI (GenAI) summarization techniques to condense complex content into concise summaries, shortening content that users can consider too long to read.

## Scenario: Add summarization capabilities to a rental property recommendation app

You're a developer working for Margie's Travel. The company's web and mobile apps connect travelers seeking lodging accommodations with homeowners and property managers willing to rent their properties. An Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database backs these apps, and you're tasked with using the `azure_ai` extension to implement new functionality to provide concise summaries of property descriptions to make it easier for customers to find relevant properties that satisfy their requirements. You aim to produce summaries that guide users toward their ideal stay whether seeking cozy apartments, waterfront views, or trendy downtown lofts.

## Summarization techniques

Two techniques are available to generate summaries when you use Azure AI Services. Understanding these methods and their differences is essential in empowering you to build intelligent applications capable of distilling complex information into digestible insights.

- **Extractive summarization**: Identifies and extracts the sentences that convey the primary idea of the text directly from the original content.

- **Abstractive summarization**: Generates creative summaries by paraphrasing and rephrasing the summarized content. The summary is designed to capture the essence of the original text.

## Learning objectives

Throughout this module, you explore GenAI summarization techniques and how they can be used directly in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server database through the `azure_ai` extension. It provides you with the knowledge to apply each summarization approach and assess the quality of generated summaries. In this module, you:

- Evaluate the summarization techniques available through Azure AI Services and the `azure_ai` extension.
- Examine the differences between extractive and abstractive summarization.
- Apply GenAI summarization techniques to data in a PostgreSQL database to gain practical experience using Azure AI Services and the `azure_ai` extension for summarization.

By the end of this module, you're equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively summarize data using GenAI techniques, enhancing your ability to extract insights from large volumes of content!
