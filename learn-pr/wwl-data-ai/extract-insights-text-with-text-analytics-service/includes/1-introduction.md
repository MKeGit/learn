Every day, the world generates a vast quantity of data; much of it text-based in the form of emails, social media posts, online reviews, business documents, and more. Artificial intelligence techniques that apply statistical and semantic models enable you to create applications that extract meaning and insights from this text-based data.

The Azure AI Language Service provides an API for common text analysis techniques that you can easily integrate into your own application code.

In this module, you will learn how to use the Azure AI Language service to:

- Detect language
- Extract key phrases
- Analyze sentiment
- Extract entities
