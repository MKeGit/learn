> A virtual machine (VM) containing the client tools you need is provided, along with the exercise instructions. Use the button above to open the VM. A limited number of concurrent sessions are available - if the hosted environment is unavailable, try again later.

In this exercise, you will work with model relationships specifically to address the need for role-playing dimensions. It will involve working with active and inactive relationships, and also Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions that modify relationship behavior.

When you finish the exercise, end the lab to close the VM. Don't forget to come back and complete the knowledge check to earn points for completing this module!
