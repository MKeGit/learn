  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Belle is a data modeler at Adventure Works who is developing a model for a data warehouse. The model includes a table that stores products and another table that stores sales of those products. Belle adds a relationship to relate the two tables. <br><br>Which cardinality type should Belle set to achieve an optimal model?"
    choices:
    - content: "One-to-one."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A one-to-one relationship implies that a product is sold once at most."
    - content: "One-to-many."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A one-to-many relationship relates the product table to the sales table. Filters applied to the product table will propagate to the sales table to allow analysis of product sales."
    - content: "Many-to-many."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a many-to-many relationship would work it isn’t optimal. Because the product table has a unique identifier for each product, a one-to-many relationship should be set."
  - content: "Akira is a data modeler at Adventure Works who is developing a model for a data warehouse. The model includes a table that stores products and another table that stores sales monthly targets of product categories. Each product can belong to multiple categories and each category can have multiple products. Akira adds a relationship to relate the two tables. <br><br>Which cardinality type should Akira set to achieve an optimal model?"
    choices:
    - content: "One-to-one."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Neither table has a unique column for product category, so it’s not possible to set a one-to-one relationship."
    - content: "One-to-many."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The product table category column will contain duplicate values, so it’s not possible to set a one-to-many relationship."
    - content: "Many-to-many."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The product table category column and the sales target category column will contain duplicate categories."
  - content: "Margaret is a data modeler at Adventure Works who is adding a measure to sales model. When evaluated, the measure must filter by filters already applied to an unrelated table. <br><br>Which DAX function should Margaret use to create a virtual relationship?"
    choices:
    - content: "`RELATEDTABLE`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `RELATEDTABLE` function retrieves a table of rows from the \"many\" side of a relationship"
    - content: "`TREATAS`."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The `TREATAS` function applies the result of a table expression as filters to columns from an unrelated table."
    - content: "`USERELATIONSHIP`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The `USERELATIONSHIP` function forces the use of a specific inactive model relationship."
