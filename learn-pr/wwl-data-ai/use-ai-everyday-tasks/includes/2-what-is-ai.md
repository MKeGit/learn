Generative AI focuses on creating new, unique content, based on the input you provide. This input is called **prompting**, which is simply asking AI for specific things. Generative AI can create entirely new and original pieces of work, such as write a poem, compose a melody, or design a graphic based on the patterns and styles it learned from existing data.

People usually interact with generative AI built into a chat application. One popular example of such an application is [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/), an AI-powered productivity tool designed to enhance your work experience by providing real-time intelligence and assistance.

> [!NOTE]
> **Behind the scenes**: Generative AI doesn't just copy or rearrange existing information; it creates something new that didn't exist before. Generative AI uses large language models (LLMs) that are trained on huge amounts of data to create outputs that are similar to the data they were trained on. Some common uses of generative AI include creating natural language text using natural language processing (NLP), generating images, and writing computer code.

## Your smart assistant to help with everyday tasks

AI can simplify your daily routines by helping you with various tasks, making your life a bit easier and more organized. Whether you're looking to get creative, plan your day, or need a bit of personal assistance, AI can make your life more manageable. Let's look at some everyday examples of how AI can be useful.

### Write creative content

Have you ever stared at a blank page with no idea where to start, or come up short on new ideas for a project? Whether you're drafting an email, writing a blog post, or brainstorming ideas for a podcast, AI can give you a starting point. It can provide suggestions, generate text, and even create entire pieces of content. For example, AI can help you:

- **Compose emails**. Quickly draft professional emails by inputting the main message and letting AI handle the rest.
- **Generate blog posts**. Create engaging blog posts by providing a topic and key points, and AI generates a well-structured article.
- **Brainstorm ideas**. Get creative ideas for your next project, whether it's a slogan, a story, or a social media post.

By using AI for creative writing and content creation, you can enhance your productivity and ensure that your materials are both engaging and effective.

### Organize and plan

AI can help you stay organized and plan your activities efficiently. AI can provide personalized recommendations and streamline your planning process. Here are some examples:

- **Plan a trip**. AI can help you organize your travel itinerary, suggest destinations, flights, and accommodations, and even recommend activities based on your preferences.
- **Manage and organize your calendar**. AI can help you schedule appointments, set reminders, and organize your daily tasks to ensure you stay on track.
- **Plan an event**. Whether you're organizing a business conference or a family gathering, AI can help you plan the event by suggesting venues, creating schedules, and managing guest lists. It can also provide reminders and updates to keep everything on track.
- **Task Management**. AI can help you manage your to-do list by prioritizing tasks, setting deadlines, and providing reminders. It can also suggest ways to break down larger projects into manageable steps.

By using AI for organizing and planning, you can save time, reduce stress, and ensure that everything runs smoothly.

### Get personal assistance

AI can act as your personal assistant, helping you manage various aspects of your life. Whether you need reminders, information, or assistance with tasks, AI is there to support you. Some examples include:

- **Answer questions**. Get quick answers to your questions, whether it's finding information online, checking the weather, or getting directions.
- **Provide recommendations**. Receive personalized recommendations for movies, books, restaurants, and more based on your preferences and past choices.
- **Automate tasks**. Automate routine tasks such as setting up meetings, sending follow-up emails, or managing your to-do list.

> [!TIP]
> **AI Agents**, also known as virtual assistants, are smart software tools that help you with different tasks based on what you need. Imagine having a reliable assistant who can handle things for you automatically. They can handle routine tasks like schedule meetings, manage emails, and even give you real-time data analysis and personalized recommendations.
>
> In Microsoft 365, these agents use advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to understand what you like and how you work. This means they can offer solutions that fit your specific needs, making your daily tasks easier and more efficient. Whether you're working with colleagues, organizing your schedule, or analyzing data, AI agents help create a smarter and more connected environment.

> ### **Responsible AI**
>
> As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's important to use it responsibly. Here are some key points to keep in mind so we can use AI in ways that are fair, trustworthy, and beneficial to society:
>
> **Provide clear and specific prompts**. Avoid sensitive topics and always review and validate outputs for accuracy and relevance.
>
> **Watch for common biases**:
>
> - **Gender bias**. AI systems can perpetuate gender stereotypes if trained on biased data. For example, a hiring algorithm might favor male candidates over female candidates due to historical data biases.
> - **Racial bias**. AI systems can exhibit racial bias, leading to discriminatory outcomes. For instance, facial recognition systems might have higher error rates for people of color compared to white individuals.
> - **Socioeconomic bias**. AI systems can favor individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. A credit scoring algorithm, for example, might disproportionately favor applicants from wealthier neighborhoods.
>
> AI should treat everyone fairly, protect privacy, and operate transparently. This helps build trust and ensures that AI systems are used in ways that respect individuals' rights and interests.
