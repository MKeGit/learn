  questions:
  - content: "A data scientist trains a regression model and wants to track the model's performance by storing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with the experiment run. Which method can be used to log the RMSE?"
    choices:
    - content: "`mlflow.log_param()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use `mlflow.log_param()` to log an input parameter."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_artifact()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use `mlflow.artifact()` to log plots and images."
    - content: "`mlflow.log_metric()`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use `mlflow.log_metric()` to log a metric like the RMSE."
  - content: "When a data scientist enables MLflow autologging, where can all model assets be found?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the model folder under Outputs + logs."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Model assets like the model pickle file will be stored in the model folder under Outputs + logs."
    - content: "In the outputs folder under Outputs + logs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When enabling autologging, the model assets will not be stored in the outputs folder."
    - content: "In the model folder under Metrics."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Artifacts like the model assets are not stored under Metrics."
