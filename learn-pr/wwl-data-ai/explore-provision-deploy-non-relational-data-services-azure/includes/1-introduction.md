Most software applications need to store data. Often data is stored in a relational database, in which the data is organized in related tables and managed by using Structured Query Language (SQL). However, many applications don't need the rigid structure of a relational database and rely on non-relational (often referred to as NoSQL) storage.

Azure Storage and Microsoft OneLake offer a range of options for storing data in the cloud. In this module, you explore the fundamental capabilities of Microsoft OneLake Azure storage and learn how it's used to support applications that require non-relational data stores.
