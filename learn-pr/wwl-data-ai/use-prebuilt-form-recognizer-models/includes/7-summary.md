There are many document types that are common to most business and Azure AI Document Intelligence includes prebuilt models to handle them. If you have a collection of such forms that you want to analyze, you can extract data by using these prebuilt models and you don't have to train your own models. You can get up and running very quickly by submitting photos and scans to the most appropriate prebuilt model.

Now that you've completed this module, you can:

- Identify business problems that you can solve by using prebuilt models in Azure AI Document Intelligence.
- Analyze forms by using the General Document, Read, and Layout models.
- Analyze forms by using financial, ID, and tax prebuilt models.
