In this module, you have learned about the capabilities of Azure SQL Database in importing data via external REST endpoints using the system-stored procedure `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint`. This feature allows direct calling of any HTTP REST endpoints from SQL queries, enabling integration with various services like Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Apps Service, and third-party APIs. You also explored how Azure Functions, a serverless compute service, can automate data movement to Azure SQL Database. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates with GitHub Actions for automatic data updates. 

One of the main takeaways from this module include understanding how to securely expose a desired REST service through Azure API Management. You learned how to implement secure API calls using `DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIALS` with the `IDENTITY` parameter. Additionally, you discovered how Azure Functions can read data from an Azure SQL database and write data to it, and how an Azure SQL trigger can be set up to respond to changes in the SQL table. You also learned about other tools like SQL Data Sync, Azure Data Factory, and BACPAC files that can be used for data synchronization, orchestration, migration, backup, and archiving.
