quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You want to specify the tone, format, and content for each interaction with your model in the playground. What should you use to customize the model response?"
    choices:
    - content: "Benchmarks"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Benchmarks are used to compare the performance of models, not to customize individual model responses."
    - content: "Grounding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Grounding is a technique used to provide context or background information to a model, not to customize its responses."
    - content: "System message"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. System messages are used to customize the model's responses by specifying the tone, format, and content for each interaction."
  - content: "What pattern can you use to ground prompts?"
    choices:
    - content: "Metadata Optimized Prompt (MOP)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. MOP isn't a recognized pattern for grounding prompts."
    - content: "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. RAG involves using a retrieval-based approach to provide relevant information to the model, which can help ground the prompts in specific knowledge or data."
    - content: "Data Understanding Support Text (DUST)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DUST isn't a recognized pattern for grounding prompts."
  - content: "Where can you test a deployed model in the Azure AI Foundry portal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Chat playground"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The chat playground is designed for interactive testing and experimentation with deployed models, allowing you to explore how the model responds in real-time."
    - content: "Sandbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A sandbox is typically a safe environment for testing code changes, but it isn't designed for testing deployed language models."
    - content: "Development toolbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The development toolbox can contain various tools for development purposes, but it isn't the place where you would test a deployed model."
