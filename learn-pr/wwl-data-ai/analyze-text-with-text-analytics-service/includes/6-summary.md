Azure AI Language provides advanced natural language processing over raw text, and includes four main functions: sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and named entity recognition.

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Click **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), clicking on the three dots to see more options, and clicking **Delete**.
