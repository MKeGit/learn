Imagine you're a developer and you're building an intelligent app. You need to choose a model to integrate with your app to make it intelligent. While exploring the many different available models that can be used for generative AI, you're faced with the paradox of choice, and are overwhelmed with the vast amount of options to choose from. You therefore want to learn how to filter the available options to find a good fit for your use case.

To find the best model for your app, you can use a structured approach by asking yourself the following questions:

1. Can AI **solve** my use case?
2. How do I **select** the best model for my use case?
3. Can I **scale** for real-world workloads?

## Build a prototype

When you start building an intelligent app, it's recommended to start by building a prototype. The prototype helps you define and scope your use case, by establishing the technical feasibility of your app. When you build a prototype, you can pick a flagship model to help decide whether AI can indeed solve your use case.

## Optimize your app

When you advance your project, you optimize your app by using techniques like prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Where during prototyping you focused on whether AI models can add value to your app, this phase focuses on selecting which specific model is right for your needs.

## Operationalize your model

After selecting a model that best suits your needs, you still want to verify that the model performs as expected. You want to ensure that your model works in production and that your app can scale to real-world workloads.

Using these three steps, you can select the right model for your use case. The Azure AI model catalog helps you through these three phases, offering a large variety of models like foundation models, open-source models, and models fine-tuned for a specific task or domain.
