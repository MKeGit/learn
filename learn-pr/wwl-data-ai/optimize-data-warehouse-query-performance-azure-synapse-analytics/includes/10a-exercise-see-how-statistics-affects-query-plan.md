Now it's your opportunity to see how statistics impact a query plan for yourself. In this exercise, you'll use a provided script to provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace in your Azure subscription; and then use a dedicated SQL Pool to query the data without statistics first, and then with statistics.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this lab, you will need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative access.
