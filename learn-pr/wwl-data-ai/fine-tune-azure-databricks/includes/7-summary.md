Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) involves the process of adapting pretrained models, such as GPT-4, to perform specific tasks or operate within a particular domain by training them on a smaller, task-specific dataset.

Fine-tuning uses the general knowledge and linguistic capabilities of LLMs to improve performance on specific tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation, or domain-specific language understanding. It allows organizations to create specialized models that are more accurate and relevant, while saving resources and time compared to training from scratch.
