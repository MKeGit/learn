When you identified the need for fine-tuning, and have your dataset, you're ready to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) using Azure Databricks.

Let's explore the steps involved in fine-tuning an LLM offered by Azure OpenAI.

## Configure your environment

To start, you need to set up your environment. Your environment includes setting up a cluster, and installing the required libraries:

- **Set up a cluster**: Within your Databricks workspace, set up a cluster with the necessary configurations. Ensure that the cluster has access to GPUs, as fine-tuning LLMs can be computationally intensive.

- **Install required libraries**: Install the necessary libraries for fine-tuning LLMs. When working with Azure OpenAI, you can use the [OpenAI Python API library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?azure-portal=true)

## Load your dataset

Next, you need to load your dataset, preprocess it, and split it into training and validation sets

Preprocessing the dataset involves tokenizing text data into smaller units like words or subwords, making it easier for language models to analyze and process.

You can tokenize text data using the tokenizer from the `transformers` library:

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["text"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
```

To split the data into training and validation sets, you can add the following code to your notebook:

```python
small_train_dataset = tokenized_datasets["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))
small_eval_dataset = tokenized_datasets["test"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(500))
```

## Fine-tune an Azure OpenAI model

To fine-tune an Azure OpenAI model in Azure Databricks, follow these steps:

1. Validate token counts.
1. Upload fine-tuning files to Azure OpenAI.
1. Submit fine-tuning job.
1. Monitor fine-tuning job.
1. Retrieve job results.
1. Deploy fine-tuned model.
1. Use fine-tuned model.

Let's explore each of these steps in more detail.

### Validate token counts

Before fine-tuning the model, it's important to validate the token counts for the training and validation datasets. You need to ensure that individual examples remain within the input token limit of the model you're using. This step involves calculating the number of tokens in each example and checking that they don't exceed the limit.

### Upload files to Azure OpenAI

After validating the token counts, you need to upload the fine-tuning files to Azure OpenAI. You initialize an OpenAI client and add the training and validation files to its environment. The client then generates file IDs for these files, which are used to initialize the fine-tuning job.

### Submit fine-tuning job

With the fine-tuning files uploaded, you can now submit the fine-tuning job. This step involves specifying the training and validation file IDs, the model to be fine-tuned, and a seed parameter for reproducibility. The fine-tuning job trains the model using the provided datasets.

### Monitor fine-tuning job

After submitting the fine-tuning job, you need to monitor its status. You can check the job ID and status to ensure that the training process is progressing as expected. Since fine-tuning can take more than an hour to complete, it's important to keep an eye on the job status.

### Retrieve job results

Once the fine-tuning job is completed, you can retrieve the final results. This step involves accessing the fine-tuned model and reviewing the output. The results include details about the fine-tuned model, which you can use for further analysis or deployment.

### Deploy fine-tuned model

Now that you have a fine-tuned model, you can deploy it as a customized model in Azure. You create a new deployment and specify the model details. Once deployed, the fine-tuned model can be used like any other deployed model in Azure AI Studio or via the chat completion API.

### Use fine-tuned model

Finally, you can use your fine-tuned model in a chat completion call. You can send a series of messages to the model and receive responses. The fine-tuned model generates more accurate and relevant responses based on the training data.
