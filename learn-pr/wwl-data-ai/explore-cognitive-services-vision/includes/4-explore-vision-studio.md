## What is Vision Studio?

Vision Studio is Azure Computer Vision's newest tool, which provides a unified portal experience for exploring, building, and integrating functionality from Image Analysis 4.0 using a set of UI-based components. The platform features a host of demo experiences accessible from a web browser. It allows developers to explore and interact with existing Vision capabilities to understand how specific operations work.

Using Studio, you can experiment with the services and learn what they offer without writing any code. To use [Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/), you need an Azure subscription for authentication and a Cognitive Services resource to begin.

## Try-it-out experiences

Vision Studio provides access to many try-it-out experiences for the different capabilities available through Vision and Image Analysis 4.0. These experiences use prebuilt, pre-configured models for performing various computer vision tasks. The try-it-out experiences allow you to upload images and receive JSON and text responses, helping you test the features and observe return values quickly using a no-code approach.
