  questions:
  - content: "What feature must be enabled for you to manage Power BI datasets from external tools?"
    choices:
    - content: "Power BI Service API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There isn't a feature called Power BI Service API."
    - content: "Read-write XMLA endpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To do more than view, you need the read-write option enabled."
    - content: "Read-only XMLA endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Read-only won't let you make updates, only view."
  - content: "What are the two views you can use to see the assets within a Power BI workspace?"
    choices:
    - content: "List and lineage view."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can see line items or relationship representation with lineage view."
    - content: "Line and relationship view."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no relationship view."
    - content: "File and lineage view."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's no file view."
  - content: "If you're developing a report that relies on a global data source and you need to add more data sources for each continent, which solution below would you implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create dataset in Analysis Services with all data sources, then use row-level security to limit what data users see based on their location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While row-level security is valid to limit data, this would be cumbersome and a large dataset."
    - content: "Create separate global and continent reports in Power BI Desktop, then use a Power BI service dashboard to highlight details for each location."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This would separate the data, but would make many extra work and assets to maintain. Plus dashboards aren't interactive."
    - content: "Create and publish a global dataset, then connect to the dataset through Power BI Desktop, and add other tables to create the specialized dataset for each location."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By creating a core global dataset, you can reduce the size of continental reports and limit assets while maintaining functionality."
