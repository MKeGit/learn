Power BI report development can be simple or complex, depending on your needs. You can create assets that can be reused for different purposes, and reduce the time consuming or repetitive tasks.

Imagine you support the finance department for a global enterprise; however, all the necessary data is stored in a single data warehouse. When you connect to this data source with Power BI Desktop, the data model is large, and different regions have different needs. You find yourself building a bulky report with many pages and slow performance.

With Power BI, you can divide the data across multiple specialized semantic models all "chained" to a core semantic model, which gives separate regions flexibility and reduce the performance impact across reports overall. Now that you have semantic models referencing other semantic models, you can use lineage view in Power BI service to explore relationships. If you're working on your semantic models with external tools, you can also use the XMLA endpoint to connect and manage semantic models.

In this module, weâ€™ll show you how to:

- Create and connect to core and specialized semantic models.
- Create Power BI template *.pbit* files.
- Track and manage report development with Power BI Project files.
- Explore the relationships between data sources, semantic models, and reports.
- Connect and manage semantic models through XMLA endpoint.

By the end of this module, you should be able to create core and specialized semantic models, explore with Power BI service lineage view, and use XMLA endpoint to connect to semantic models.
