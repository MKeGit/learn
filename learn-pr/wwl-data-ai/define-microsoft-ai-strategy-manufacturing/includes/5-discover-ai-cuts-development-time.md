The manufacturing sector collects the largest volume of data of any global industry each year, but it only uses a fraction of the industrial data collected in factories.

One company partnered with Microsoft to develop a real-time, data-driven operations solution for global manufacturers to achieve breakthrough performance by continuously improving sustainability, resilience, and profitability. Let's take a look at their experience. 

## The organization

The manufacturing company in our example is a market leader in industrial automation and industrial software. The company provides innovative solutions for various industries, such as energy, healthcare, mobility, and infrastructure.

Historically, the company has played a vital role in technological innovation. Now, the company is incorporating AI into their business processes to keep their competitive edge.

## The challenge

The company realized that they needed to massively adopt AI to support all their departments. For example, they’ve used **forecasting AI models** to predict increased demand to better adjust production and sales planning for a long time.

However, the development process for these AI systems was **costly, slow, and confusing**. Business users who required an AI solution depended on data analysts to develop it, and the collaboration between them was often full of noise and misunderstandings. Data analysts lacked a platform that would allow them to reuse code and components, so they had to build every new model from scratch. The process was highly inefficient and could take several months.

The company realized that they needed to change their AI development process. They needed a robust, fast, and reliable **AI platform** to develop, test, and deploy models in a scalable way.

## The solution

The solution creates a common data foundation by capturing and contextualizing data from the entire factory to deliver a system-wide view of the end-to-end manufacturing process. The addition of a generative AI copilot, powered by Azure OpenAI, further democratizes industrial data with generative AI, making plant data, analytics, and insights even more accessible and impactful for everyone—from shop floor operators to executives.​

## The results

The **drop in the development time for AI models** is significant. While implementing a new AI solution used to take several months, now it only requires a few weeks.

Likewise, **code maintenance** is now much easier and faster thanks to standardization. Before, maintaining the code of three projects required three data analysts, whereas today a single worker can maintain code for many projects.
