An educator-specific survey and a student survey are located in the [Microsoft Learn for Educators Portal](https://aka.ms/MSLEPort). Providing your feedback will help us better understand your experience as a faculty member within the Microsoft Learn for Educators program. Encouraging your students to complete the student survey will help us better understand their experiences with the Microsoft technology curriculum.

The educator survey link is located in the View your courses tab on the [Microsoft Learn for Educators Portal](https://aka.ms/MSLEPort). The student survey link is located in the e-mail with the subject line, Getting students certified in Microsoft technologies you received for each course you have registered.

We look forward to hearing from you and your students.
