Once you have completed teaching your course, take a quick breather. And celebrate this milestone!

We hope your course was a success and that you consider using Microsoft curriculum and teaching materials in your classes again.

Find new materials or updates to your current course on [Microsoft Learn for Educators](https://aka.ms/msle). Find others who are teaching new titles that interest you through the MSLE Teams community or chat with members of the MSLE community moderators there.

Once you have determined what you are going to be teaching, add those courses to the MSLE portal so that we can continue to support you and your students.

Thank you for letting us partner with you as we seek to transform the future of education together.
