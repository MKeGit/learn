This is an opportunity for your school to build relationships with industry leaders, get feedback on curriculum development, find partners for capstone projects, book in demand guest speakers, and lay more groundwork with local industry partners to connect your students to jobs and internships.

We want to help you cultivate a reputation as a forward thinking and innovative institution, adding an emphasis on real world technology skills to attract new students to your program, and increase your standing among your peers and other institutions.
