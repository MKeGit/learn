Azure HDInsight in conjunction with other Azure services provides a comprehensive multi-tiered security solution and is a shared responsibility between Microsoft and the customer.

As a data architect you need to be able to design data processing landscapes that are compliant, secure, and auditable on demand. Security considerations are not just restricted to the HDInsight service in question, but span across multiple other services that HDInsight interacts with. This can include Azure networking, operating systems, Microsoft Entra Domain Services, and Azure Storage. 

In this module, you will learn what the major security areas of HDInsight are, and how they are managed between Microsoft and the customer. You will learn about perimeter security, operating system security, application and middleware security, data access security, and how each of these services is met with various components and applied to HDInsight.  

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will:

- Describe HDInsight security
- Implement network Security
- Understand operating system security
- manage application middleware security
- Implement data access security
