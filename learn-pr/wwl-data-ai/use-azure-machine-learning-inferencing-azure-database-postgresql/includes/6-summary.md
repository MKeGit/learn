Azure Machine Learning allows you to train custom machine learning models using various common open-source toolchains. With the `azure_ai` extension, you can invoke trained and deployed machine learning models, bringing the results directly into the database. With this solution, you can quickly and easily generate predictions given data you already have in tables, making it possible to incorporate insights from a machine learning model in an easy-to-use function.
