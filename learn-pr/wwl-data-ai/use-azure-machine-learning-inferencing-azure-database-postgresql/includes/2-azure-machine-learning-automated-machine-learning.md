**Azure Machine Learning** is a cloud-based platform streamlining end-to-end machine learning workflows. It caters to data scientists, developers, and engineers, enabling them to seamlessly create, train, deploy, and manage machine learning models. Within Azure Machine Learning, models are developed using popular frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. Once trained, these models are deployed as endpoints, stable URLs where predictions can be requested. Whether real-time inference (handled by online endpoints) or batch processing (handled by batch endpoints), Azure Machine Learning equips us to make accurate predictions and drive intelligent applications in production systems.

## Automated machine learning

Automated machine learning (or auto machine learning) is the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build machine learning models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity, all while sustaining model quality. Automated machine learning in Azure Machine Learning is based on a breakthrough from our [Microsoft Research division](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/automl/).

For the upcoming exercise, you'll use auto-machine learning to train a regression model based on historical company data.
