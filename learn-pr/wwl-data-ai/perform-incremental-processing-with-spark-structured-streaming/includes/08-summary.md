Incremental data processing using Delta Live Tables (DLT) in Azure Databricks offers a robust and efficient way to manage and process large volumes of data by only processing the changes (deltas) since the last update. This approach significantly reduces the amount of data processed in each run, leading to faster processing times and more efficient use of computational resources. Delta Live Tables leverage the power of Delta Lake, a highly optimized storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. With Delta Live Tables, users can define data processing pipelines that automatically handle the ingestion, transformation, and aggregation of streaming and batch data, ensuring that data is always up-to-date and accurate.
