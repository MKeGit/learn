Setting up real-time data sources for incremental processing using Delta Live Tables (DLT) and SQL in Azure Databricks involves integrating and configuring streaming data inputs, defining Delta Live Tables for processing, and applying SQL transformations for efficient data handling. This setup allows for continuous data ingestion and transformation, ensuring that the latest data is always available for analytics and reporting. 

First, to set up real-time data sources, you need to identify and configure the streaming sources from which your data will be ingested. These sources can include Kafka, Event Hubs, or other message brokers that support streaming data. For instance, if you are using Azure Event Hubs, you would configure your Databricks workspace to connect to the Event Hub instance. This involves setting up the appropriate credentials, specifying the Event Hub namespace, and defining the consumer group from which Databricks will read the streaming data. An example configuration might include setting the Event Hub connection string and other parameters in the Databricks notebook or cluster configuration.

Next, you create Delta Live Tables to process the ingested data incrementally. Delta Live Tables are designed to simplify the ETL process by allowing you to define data pipelines declaratively. You define the structure and transformations of your data using SQL or Python. For example, you might create a Delta Live Table that reads from the streaming source and applies transformations such as filtering, aggregations, or joins. The following SQL code snippet demonstrates how to define a Delta Live Table that reads from an Event Hub source and performs a basic transformation:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAMING LIVE TABLE transformed_data AS
SELECT
  body AS message,
  properties['eventType'] AS event_type,
  enqueuedTime AS event_time
FROM
  cloud_files('dbfs:/mnt/event_hub_data')
  WITH FORMAT 'json'
```

Once the Delta Live Tables are defined, you need to configure the data pipeline to handle incremental updates. This involves setting the appropriate configuration options to ensure that the pipeline processes new data as it arrives without reprocessing the entire dataset. Delta Live Tables support this by maintaining state information that tracks which data has already been processed. You can use configurations such as cloud_files("path").withOptions({"startingOffsets": "earliest"}) to specify the starting point for data ingestion, ensuring that only new data is processed in subsequent runs.

To ensure efficient and reliable processing, it's crucial to monitor and manage the Delta Live Tables pipeline. Azure Databricks provides tools for monitoring the performance and health of your data pipelines. You can set up alerts and logging to track the progress of data ingestion and transformation, and to identify any issues that may arise. For example, you can use the Databricks Jobs UI to schedule and monitor the execution of your Delta Live Tables pipelines, ensuring that they run at the desired frequency and handle data updates as expected.

Finally, you can enhance the functionality of your incremental processing setup by integrating additional features such as window functions, watermarking, and advanced SQL operations. For example, you might use window functions to perform time-based aggregations on the streaming data, or watermarking to handle late-arriving data. An example SQL query that uses a window function to calculate the average event value over a sliding window of time is shown below:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STREAMING LIVE TABLE windowed_aggregates AS
SELECT
  event_type,
  AVG(CAST(message AS FLOAT)) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type ORDER BY event_time RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL 1 HOUR PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS avg_value
FROM
  LIVE.transformed_data
```
By following these steps and leveraging the capabilities of Delta Live Tables and SQL in Azure Databricks, you can set up a robust system for real-time data processing that handles incremental updates efficiently. This setup ensures that your data pipelines are always up-to-date, providing fresh and accurate data for downstream analytics and decision-making.
