The curriculum and teaching materials available through the MSLE program are the same materials Microsoft Technical Trainers and Microsoft Certified Trainers use in training the workforce of Microsoft customers and partners.

The materials range from applied skills and fundamentals curriculum all the way up to advanced role based curriculum across all of the Microsoft solution areas like data and AI, business applications, digital and app innovation, infrastructure, modern work, and security.

In addition to PowerPoint files which are the ready to teach slides used in the delivery of the content and the trainer handbook which is the detailed guide used by Microsoft Certified Trainers and Microsoft Technical Trainers to prepare for teaching IT professionals in a business setting, we've created an Educator Teaching Guide and an Assessment Guide for some of our most in-demand courses. 

The Educator Teaching Guide includes a planning checklist to prepare to teach the course, a high-level overview of the course materials, planning tools and resources, as well as recommended best practices for classroom labs and demos.

The Assessment Guide provides guidance on the development of formative and summative assessments for your students.

Other benefits include:

- Real world labs: Lab seats to provision Azure based labs for your students, enabling hands on experience and skills validation. Note: you will need to enter your course details in the MSLE portal to gain access to the labs for each class you are teaching each term.
- Curriculum integration support: access to a learning path: [Implement certifications in academic programs](https://aka.ms/ImplementationLP) to help you implement industry recognized credentials and academic programs including how to implement Microsoft credentials in new or existing academic degree programs.
