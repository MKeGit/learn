Our world is changing at a remarkable speed. And this speed means that it's nearly impossible to predict what skills students entering the workforce will require in the next five to 10 years, let alone over the span of their careers. 

As faculty members, you play a critical role in ensuring that students are broadly educated and technically skilled regardless of major or discipline to prepare them for the jobs of today and tomorrow. 

[Microsoft Learn for Educators (MSLE)](https://aka.ms/MSLE) provides higher education institutions and faculty with a suite of tools and resources that enable technical skills instruction aligned to the industry recognized Microsoft credentials by augmenting the existing degree paths of your students. With these in-demand skills and credentials, you'll set them up for real world success.
