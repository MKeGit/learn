  questions:
  - content: "A machine learning engineer wants to deploy a model to an endpoint to get real-time predictions. What kind of endpoint will meet the requirements?"
    choices:
    - content: "A managed online endpoint."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "For real-time predictions, a managed online endpoint is best suited."
    - content: "A batch inference endpoint."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A batch inference endpoint will trigger a pipeline to generate batch predictions."
    - content: "A model deployment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A model can be deployed to both a managed online and batch inference endpoint. It depends on what kind of endpoint you use whether you can get real-time predictions."
  - content: "When deploying a MLflow model, what isn't necessary to include in the deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "The model files and environment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When deploying a MLflow model, the model files still need to be included in the deployment."
    - content: "The scoring script and model files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "When deploying a MLflow model, the model files still need to be included in the deployment."
    - content: "The scoring script and environment."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct. The scoring script and environment don't need to be included."
