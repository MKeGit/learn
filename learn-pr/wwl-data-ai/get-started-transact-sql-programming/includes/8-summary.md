Programming with Transact-SQL can be as simple as building a series of SELECT statements, or more complex, applying batches, conditional logic, and loops to control the flow of your program.

In this module, you've learned how to:

- Use the language elements of T-SQL used for simple programming tasks.
- Understand how batches are handled by SQL Server.
- Declare and assign variables and synonyms.
- Use IF and WHILE blocks to control program flow.
