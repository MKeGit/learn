As an educator, you play a pivotal role in empowering students for future success. Skilling our future generations is critical work. With the increasing demand for cloud and AI skills, the AI-900 Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals course aims to be accessible to everyone and anyone. This learning path may be your students' first introduction to these concepts, and this course serves as a foundation for some of our more advanced courses. 

We suggest you utilize Microsoft Whiteboard to explain concepts and steps needed to create or develop a solution. Knowledge checks and short quizzes that test the student's understanding of these key concepts and skills covered in each lesson can help ensure the students are learning the material. Incorporating storytelling and sharing customer and partner success stories can help inspire students by illustrating the applications and benefits of AI and Azure. Highlight resources like the Microsoft Customer Stories or Microsoft Partner Network to find and share success stories with your students.

Before we begin, make sure you're using the most up-to-date version of the Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC). It's recommended that you log into the [Learning Download Center](https://aka.ms/ldc) (LDC) at least quarterly. If you haven't already done so, please download the course materials from the LDC before continuing with this module.
