When you use Large Language Models (LLMs) with Azure Databricks, it's important to focus on responsible AI. Responsible AI means making sure your AI development and deployment are ethical, transparent, and accountable.

Azure Databricks offers great tools to help you monitor, manage, and fine-tune LLMs. Specifically Unity Catalog and Mosaic AI make it easier to follow responsible AI practices.

Responsible AI involves detecting bias, explaining how AI decisions are made, and following data privacy rules. This ensures your AI solutions aren't only powerful but also fair and trustworthy.

By incorporating responsible AI principles throughout the LLM lifecycle, you can create AI systems that align with societal values and regulations while getting the most out of these advanced models.
