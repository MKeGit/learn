    - content: "Providing subject matter experts with AI development training so they can build their own AI models."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Training every subject matter expert in AI development would be time-intensive and costly."
    - content: "Encouraging subject matter experts to ask developers and data scientists whenever they need an AI model."
