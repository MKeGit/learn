You work for a utilities company that has IoT sensors that collect temperature data. The temperatures are logged in a MongoDB database, together with a timestamp. Each device has a unique ID. You'll run a MongoDB application that simulates these devices, and stores the data in the database. You'll also use a second application that enables a user to query statistical information about each device. After migrating the database from MongoDB to Cosmos DB, you'll configure both applications to connect to Cosmos DB, and verify that they still function correctly.

In this exercise, you'll take an existing MongoDB database and migrate it to Cosmos DB. You'll use the Azure Database Migration Service. You'll also see how to reconfigure existing applications that use the MongoDB database to connect to the Cosmos DB database instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Data Migration Service isn't supported in the free Azure sandbox environment. You can perform these steps in your own personal subscription, or just follow along to understand how to migrate your database.

## Create a MongoDB database on Azure

First you'll create the MongoDB database for holding the data captured from the temperature devices.

1. Select **Add**.

> [!NOTE]
> You'll configure MongoDB to use port 8080 in this exercise. You only need to do this due to security constraints in this environment. You would normally use the default MongoDB port of **27017**.

### Install MongoDB

1. In the menu the Azure portal, select **All resources**.
1. On the **All resources** page, select **mongodbserver-ip**.
1. On the **mongodbserver-ip** page, make a note of the **IP address**.
1. In the toolbar at the top of the Azure portal, select **Cloud Shell**.
1. If the **You have no storage mounted** message box appears, select **Create storage**.
1. When the Cloud Shell starts, in the drop-down list above the Cloud Shell window, select **Bash**.
1. In the Cloud Shell, enter the following command to connect to the mongodbserver virtual machine. Replace *\<ip address\>* with the value of the **mongodbserver-ip** IP address:

    ```bash
    ssh azureuser@<ip address>
    ```

1. At the prompt, type **yes** to continue connecting.
1. Enter the password **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd**.
1. To reload the package database, enter this command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

1. To install MongoDB, enter this command:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
    ```

    The installation should proceed with messages about installing, preparing, and unpacking packages. It can take a few minutes for the installation to complete.

### Configure the MongoDB database

By default, the Mongo DB instance is configured to run without authentication. In this task, you'll configure MongoDB to bind to the local network interface so that it can accept connections from other computers. You'll also enable authentication and create the necessary user account to perform migration. Finally, you'll add an account that a test application can use to query the database.

1. To open the MongoDB configuration file, run this command:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/mongodb.conf
    ```

1. In the file, locate the **bind_ip** setting, and set it to **0.0.0.0**.
1. Locate the **port** setting, and set it to **8080**.
1. To save the configuration file, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> and then press <kbd>CTRL + X</kbd>. Press <kbd>y</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save the modified buffer.
1. To restart the MongoDB service and apply your changes, enter this command:

    ```bash
    sudo service mongodb restart
    ```

1. To connect to the MongoDB service, enter this command:

    ```bash
    mongo --host 127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. At the **>** prompt, to switch to the **admin** database, run this command:

    ```bash
    use admin;
    ```

1. To create a new user named **administrator**, run the following command. You can enter the command on one line or across multiple lines for better readability. The command is executed when the `mongo` program reaches the semicolon:

    ```bash
    db.createUser(
        {
            user: "administrator",
            pwd: "Pa55w.rd",
            roles: [
                { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
                { role: "clusterMonitor", db:"admin" },
                "readWriteAnyDatabase"
            ]
        }
    );
    ```

1. To exit the `mongo` program, enter this command;

    ```bash
    exit;
    ```

1. To connect to MongoDB with the new administrator's account, run this command:

    ```bash
    mongo admin -u "administrator" -p "Pa55w.rd" --host 127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. To switch to the **DeviceData** database, execute this command:

    ```bash
    use DeviceData;    
    ```

1. To create a user named **deviceadmin**, which the app will use to connect to the database, run this command:

    ```bash
    db.createUser(
        {
            user: "deviceadmin",
            pwd: "Pa55w.rd",
            roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "DeviceData" } ]
        }
    );
    ```

1. To exit the `mongo` program, enter this command;

    ```bash
    exit;
    ```

1. Run the following command restart the mongodb service. Verify that the service restarts without any error messages:

    ```bash
    sudo service mongodb restart
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify that you can now log in to mongodb as the deviceadmin user:

    ```bash
    mongo DeviceData -u "deviceadmin" -p "Pa55w.rd" --host 127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

1. At the **>** prompt, run the following command to quit the mongo shell:

    ```bash
    exit;
    ```

1. At the bash prompt, run the following command to disconnect from the MongoDB server and return to the Cloud Shell:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## Populate and query the MongoDB database

You have now created a MongoDB server and database. The next step is to demonstrate the sample applications that can populate and query the data in this database.

### Build and run an App to populate the MongoDB database

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to download the sample code:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-060T00A-Migrating-your-Database-to-Cosmos-DB migration-workshop-apps
    ```

1. Move to the **migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/MongoDeviceCapture** folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/MongoDeviceDataCapture
    ```

1. Use the **Code** editor to examine the **TemperatureDevice.cs** file:

    ```bash
    code TemperatureDevice.cs
    ```

    The code in this file contains a class named **TemperatureDevice** that simulates a temperature device capturing data and saving it in a MongoDB database. It uses the MongoDB library for the .NET Framework. The  **TemperatureDevice** constructor connects to the database using settings stored in the application configuration file. The **RecordTemperatures** method generates a reading and writes it to the database.

1. Close the code editor, and then open the **ThermometerReading.cs** file:

   ```bash
   code ThermometerReading.cs
   ```

    This file shows the structure of the documents that the application stores in the database. Each document contains the following fields:

    - An object ID. The is the "_id" field generated by MongoDB to uniquely identify each document.
    - A device ID. Each device has a number with the prefix "Device".
    - The temperature recorded by the device.
    - The date and time when the temperature was recorded.
  
1. Close the code editor, and then open the **App.config** file:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

    This file contains the settings for connecting to the MongoDB database. 

1. Set the value for the **Address** key to the IP address of the MongoDB server that you recorded earlier.
1. Change the port the app uses to **8080**.
1. Save the file and close the editor using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>, and then <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>.
1. Run the following command to rebuild the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ````

    This can take around 5 minutes.

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    The application simulates 100 devices running simultaneously. Allow the application to run for a couple of minutes, and then press Enter to stop it.

### Build and run another app to query the MongoDB database

1. Move to the **DP160T00A-Migrating-your-Database-to-Cosmos-DB/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery** folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery
    ```

    This folder contains another application that you can use to analyze the data captured by each device.

1. Use the **Code** editor to examine the **Program.cs** file:

    ```bash
    code Program.cs
    ```

    The application connects to the database (using the **ConnectToDatabase** method at the bottom of the file) and then prompts the user for a device number. The application uses the MongoDB library for the .NET Framework to create and run an aggregate pipeline that calculates the following statistics for the specified device:

    - The number of readings recorded.
    - The average temperature recorded.
    - The lowest reading.
    - The highest reading.
    - The latest reading.

1. Close the code editor, and then open the **App.config** file:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

1. Set the value for the **Address** key to the IP address of the MongoDB server that you recorded earlier.
1. Change the port the app uses to **8080**.
1. Save the file and close the editor using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>, and then <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd>.
1. Build and run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

1. At the **Enter Device Number** prompt, enter a value between 0 and 99. The application will query the database, calculate the statistics, and display the results. Press **Q** to quit the application.

## Migrate the MongoDB Database to Cosmos DB

The next step is to take the MongoDB database and transfer it to Cosmos DB.

### Create a Cosmos account and database

1. Return to the Azure portal.
1. In the menu, select **+ Create a resource**.
1. On the **New** page, in the **Search the Marketplace** box, type ***Azure Cosmos DB**, end then press Enter.

1. Enter the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```shell
    db.Temperatures.find({deviceID: "Device 99"})
    ```

    This command fetches and displays the documents for Device 99.

## Reconfigure and run existing applications to use Cosmos DB

The final step is to reconfigure your existing MongoDB applications to connect to Cosmos DB, and verify that they still work. This requires you to modify the way in which your applications connect to the database, but the logic of your applications should remain unchanged.

1. In the **mongodb*nnn*** pane, under **Settings**, select **Connection String**.
1. On the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page, make a note of the following settings:

    - Host
    - Username
    - Primary Password
  
1. Return to the Cloud Shell window (reconnect if the session has timed out), and move to the **migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery** folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery
    ```

1. Open the App.config file in the Code editor:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

1. In the **Settings for MongoDB** section of the file, comment out the existing settings.
1. Uncomment the settings in the **Settings for Cosmos DB Mongo API** section, and set the values for these settings as follows:

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Address | The **HOST** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |
    | Port | The **PORT** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |
    | Username | The **USERNAME** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |
    | Password | The **PRIMARY PASSWORD** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |

    The completed file should look similar to this:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
            <add key="Database" value="DeviceData" />
            <add key="Collection" value="Temperatures" />

            <!-- Settings for MongoDB 
            <add key="Address" value="nn.nn.nn.nn" />
            <add key="Port" value="27017" />
            <add key="Username" value="deviceadmin" />
            <add key="Password" value="Pa55w.rd" />
            End of settings for MongoDB -->

            <!-- Settings for CosmosDB Mongo API -->
            <add key="Address" value="mongodbnnn.documents.azure.com"/>
            <add key="Port" value="10255"/>
            <add key="Username" value="mongodbnnn"/>
            <add key="Password" value="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=="/>
            <!-- End of settings for CosmosDB Mongo API -->
        </appSettings>
    </configuration>
    ```

1. Save the file, and then close the Code editor.

1. Open the Program.cs file using the Code editor:

    ```bash
    code Program.cs
    ```

1. Scroll down to the **ConnectToDatabase** method.
1. Comment out the line that sets the credentials for connecting to MongoDB, and uncomment the statements that specify the credentials for connecting to Cosmos DB. The code should look like this:

    ```c#
    // Connect to the MongoDB database
    MongoClient client = new MongoClient(new MongoClientSettings
    {
        Server = new MongoServerAddress(address, port),
        ServerSelectionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),

        //
        // Credential settings for MongoDB
        //

        // Credential = MongoCredential.CreateCredential(database, azureLogin.UserName, azureLogin.SecurePassword),

        //
        // Credential settings for CosmosDB Mongo API
        //

        UseTls = true,
        Credential = new MongoCredential("SCRAM-SHA-1", new MongoInternalIdentity(database, azureLogin.UserName), new PasswordEvidence(azureLogin.SecurePassword))

        // End of Mongo API settings
    });
    ```

    These changes are necessary because the original MongoDB database was not using an SSL connection. Cosmos DB always uses SSL.

1. Save the file, and then close the Code editor.
1. Rebuild and run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

1. At the **Enter Device Number** prompt, enter a device number between 0 and 99. The application should run exactly as before, except this time it is using the data held in the Cosmos DB database.

## Improve query performance in Cosmos DB

Cosmos DB allows you to add more indexes to improve query performance. As we are aggregating over deviceID adding that field as an index will speed up your queries.

1. Switch back to the Azure portal.
1. On the left, select **Data Explorer**.
1. In the **Data Explorer** pane, expand the **DeviceData** database, expand the **Temperatures** collection, and then select **Settings**.

1. Select **Indexing policy**.
1. Under **_id** add a new index, enter **deviceID** for the **Definition**, and select **Single Field** for the **Type**.
1. Select **Save** to add the new index.
1. Return to your Cloud Shell to try your query again, and note the improved response in your application.
1. Test the application with other device numbers. Enter **Q** to finish.

You have successfully migrated a MongoDB database to Cosmos DB, and reconfigured an existing MongoDB application to connect to the new Cosmos DB database.

### Clean up the resources you've created

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've performed these steps in your own personal subscription, you can delete the resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources. Resources left running can cost you money.

1. Using the Cloud Shell run this command to delete the resource group:

    ```azurecli
    az group delete --name mongodbrg
    ```
