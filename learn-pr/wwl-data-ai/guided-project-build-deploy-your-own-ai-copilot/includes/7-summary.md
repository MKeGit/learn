Your goal was to develop a web application that uses Azure's powerful AI and database services to provide enhanced search capabilities. You import data into Azure Cosmos DB with generated embeddings, and created a vector index to facilitate efficient vector searches. To enrich search results, you used GPT-3.5, allowing your AI copilot to deliver user-friendly insights. You then set up REST endpoints to enable web-based interactions with the vector and GPT search functions. After successfully testing the application container locally, you deployed it on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), achieving a fully operational and scalable AI-powered solution. Fantastic work!
