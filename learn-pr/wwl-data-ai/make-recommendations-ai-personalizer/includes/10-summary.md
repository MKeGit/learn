In this module, you learned how to use Azure AI Personalizer to improve decision-making for your company's apps in near real-time.

Azure AI Personalizer enables you to empower your applications to make smarter decisions at large scale through the notion of reinforcement learning.

Azure AI Personalizer processes information about the state of your app (contexts), and possible decisions (actions) to decide the best decision to make. Your application provides feedback (rewards) to Azure AI Personalizer. This way, it learns how to improve decision-making in near-real time and can provide better recommendations in the future.

Now that you have completed this module, you learned to:

- Create  an Azure AI Personalizer resource
- Configure a learning loop
- Configure learning behavior
- Import and export learning and model settings
- Use inference explainability
- Run evaluations
