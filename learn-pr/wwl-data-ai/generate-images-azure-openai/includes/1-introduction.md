The Azure OpenAI service enables you to use language models to generate content based on natural language prompts. One of these models is the DALL-E image generation model, which is capable of creating original graphical content based on natural language descriptions of a desired image.

The ability to use AI to generate graphics has a number of applications; including the creation of illustrations or photorealistic images for articles or marketing collateral, generation of unique product or company logos, or any scenario where a desired image can be described.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the DALL-E model in an instance of the Azure OpenAI service, and retrieve the images it generates.
