As organizations and individuals collaborate with people in other cultures and geographic locations, they continue to need ways to remove language barriers. 

One solution is to hire multilingual people to translate between languages. However the scarcity of such skills, and the number of possible language combinations can make this approach difficult to scale. Increasingly, automated translation, sometimes known as *machine translation*, is being employed to solve this problem.  

In this module, we explore Azure AI Translator and Azure AI Speech's cloud-based neural machine translation capabilities.
