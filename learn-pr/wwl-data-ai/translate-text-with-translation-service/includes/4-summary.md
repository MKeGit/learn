The ability to automate translation between languages helps remove barriers to collaboration across cultural and geographical boundaries.

Azure AI Translator and Azure AI Speech provide cloud-based intelligence to support text and speech translation, enabling a wide range of scenarios for real-time and batch-process translation.

You can find out more about the using these services for translation in the [Azure AI Translator documentation](/azure/ai-services/translator?azure-portal=true) and the [Azure AI Speech documentation](/azure/ai-services/speech-service?azure-portal=true).

## Clean-up

It's a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. 

If you are continuing on to other modules in this learning path you can keep your resources for use in other labs.

If you have finished learning, you can delete the resource group or individual resources from your Azure subscription:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), in the **Resource groups** page, open the resource group you specified when creating your resource.

2. Select **Delete resource group**, type the resource group name to confirm you want to delete it, and select **Delete**. You can also choose to delete individual resources by selecting the resource(s), selecting the three dots to see more options, and selecting **Delete**.
