  questions:
  - content: "What is one of the key advantages of using serverless compute in Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "It provides elastic scalability, automatically adjusting compute resources based on the workload requirements."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This approach ensures that the right amount of resources is allocated at any given time, optimizing performance, and cost."
    - content: "It requires manual resource provisioning and management."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Serverless compute eliminates the need for manual resource provisioning and management."
    - content: "It operates on a fixed-cost model."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Serverless compute operates on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for the compute power you actually use."
  - content: "What is the role of the ANALYZE TABLE command in implementing cost-based optimization in Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "It partitions datasets into smaller, manageable parts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ANALYZE TABLE command doesn't partition datasets. It collects and maintains data statistics."
    - content: "It collects and maintains data statistics."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The ANALYZE TABLE command is used to gather statistics on individual tables or entire databases, aiding in efficient query execution."
    - content: "It caches intermediate results of queries in memory."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The ANALYZE TABLE command doesn't cache query results. It's used for gathering data statistics."
  - content: "What is the role of Delta Live Tables in implementing Change Data Capture with Azure Databricks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delta Live Tables are used to store the original data before changes are made."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Delta Live Tables aren't just storage for original data. They're used to define data flow and transformation logic."
    - content: "Delta Live Tables are used to define the data flow and transformation logic, including specifying the source table. The transformations required to capture and process the changes, and the target table where the processed data are stored."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Delta Live Tables play a crucial role in defining the data flow and transformation logic in the implementation of Change Data Capture with Azure Databricks."
    - content: "Delta Live Tables are used only for monitoring the performance of the pipeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Delta Live Tables do aid in monitoring, their primary role is in defining data flow and transformation logic."
