Performance optimization in Azure Databricks uses Apache Spark and Delta Live Tables (DLT) to handle large-scale data processing efficiently. Spark's in-memory computing capabilities, combined with strategies like caching frequently accessed data, optimizing shuffle operations, and using optimized data formats like Parquet, enhance performance. Delta Live Tables further improve efficiency by automating the creation of real-time data pipelines with built-in quality and reliability features. DLT ensures data consistency with ACID transactions and schema enforcement by using Delta Lake. Effective partitioning, Z-Ordering, and auto-optimization features in DLT contribute to reducing latency and improving the overall performance of data workflows in Azure Databricks.

In this module, you learned how to:
- Use serverless compute and parallelism with Delta live tables
- Perform cost based optimization and query performance
- Use Change Data Capture (CDC)
- Use enhanced autoscaling capabilities
- Implement Observability and enhance data quality metrics
