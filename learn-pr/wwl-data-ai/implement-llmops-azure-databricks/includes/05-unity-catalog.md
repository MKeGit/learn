Unity Catalog is a tool that provides centralized governance for all data and AI assets, including Large Language Models (LLMs). By using Unity Catalog, you can streamline the management of machine learning models, datasets, and other related assets, ensuring consistency, security, and compliance across your organization.

## Implement Unity Catalog for your LLMOps workflow

Unity Catalog allows you to manage all your data and AI assets in a single, **centralized** location. Centralizing your assets simplifies the process of tracking and organizing your machine learning models, datasets, and other resources, making it easier to maintain an overview of your LLMOps workflows.

You can implement **fine-grained access controls** to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and models. With access controls, you protect your intellectual property and maintain compliance with data privacy regulations.

Unity Catalog facilitates collaboration among data scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders by providing a **shared platform** for accessing and managing machine learning assets. Such collaboration promotes transparency and enables teams to work together more effectively on LLMOps projects.

After implementing catalogs to logically group your assets, you can make use of the comprehensive **auditing** capabilities, allowing you to track changes and access to your data and models. Monitoring ensures that you can maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies, while also providing a clear audit trail for troubleshooting and accountability.
