LLMOps, or Large Language Model Operations, focuses on the deployment, management, and optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications.

As the use of AI and LLMs like GPT-4 grows across industries, LLMOps addresses the unique challenges of integrating these models into production environments.

LLMOps includes model deployment, managing, monitoring, and ensuring ethical and responsible use of AI. When you implement LLMOps, you harness the full potential of LLMs while maintaining performance, security, and compliance standards.
