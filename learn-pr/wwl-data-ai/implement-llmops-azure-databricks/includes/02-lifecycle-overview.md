**MLOps** (**Machine Learning Operations**) and **LLMOps** (**Large Language Model Operations**) represent two distinct paradigms in the operationalization of machine learning models, each with its own set of challenges, tools, and workflows.

While traditional MLOps focuses on deploying and managing a wide variety of machine learning models, LLMOps is tailored specifically for **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**), which have unique requirements in terms of scale, data management, and model tuning.

Azure Databricks supports both MLOps and LLMOps, but the implementation details differ significantly. Let's explore the difference by comparing MLops to LLMOps.

## Compare MLOps to LLMOps

Traditional machine learning typically involves training a model, like a regression model, or a more complex neural network.

:::image type="content" source="../media/machine-learning-overview.png" alt-text="Diagram of traditional machine learning overview.":::

The machine learning process includes:

1. Collecting, exploring, and preparing a suitable **dataset**.
1. Choosing an **algorithm** and defining the **data labels**.
1. Using the trained model to generate **predictions** on new data.

The operational focus is on ensuring that these models can scale efficiently across various environments and data volumes.

Azure Databricks facilitates MLOps by providing scalable compute resources, integration with Azure Machine Learning, and tools like MLflow for model tracking and deployment.

LLMOps, on the other hand, deals with pretrained language models that work with constructs like text-based inputs, known as prompts.

The process of using a language model includes:

1. Combining **data** with expected **prompts**.
1. Choosing and configuring a **pretrained language model**.
1. Using the configured model to generate **responses** on new prompts.

LLMOps deals with models that are orders of magnitude larger, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4. LLMs require not only more computational power but also specialized infrastructure to handle their scale.

Azure Databricks offers *optimized clusters*, *distributed computing*, and the *integration with Azure OpenAI*, enabling the deployment of LLMs at scale.

When we compare MLOps to LLMOps, there are some key differences we need to understand.

### Manage unstructured text data

In traditional MLOps, data management is centered around structured and semi-structured data. Within data management, the focus lies on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and pipeline automation.

LLMOps, however, requires handling **large amounts of unstructured text data**, necessitating more sophisticated data ingestion and preprocessing pipelines.

Azure Databricks, combined with Azure AI Services, allows for the ingestion and processing of large text corpora, enabling the efficient training and fine-tuning of LLMs.

### Fine-tune instead of training from scratch

Traditional MLOps often involves iterative model training and hyperparameter tuning, with a focus on optimizing model performance for specific tasks. Tools like Hyperopt and AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) in Azure Databricks help automating these processes.

LLMOps, however, places a **greater emphasis on fine-tuning pretrained models** on specific tasks or domains.

Azure Databricks supports fine-tuning through its integration with the Azure OpenAI service, enabling users to fine-tune LLMs like GPT-4 with minimal code changes, using the power of distributed computing for faster training times.

### Consume your deployed your model

In traditional MLOps, deployment involves integrating models into production systems using REST APIs, batch processing, or real-time inference endpoints.

However, in LLMOps, **deployment happens earlier in the lifecycle** because you're working with pretrained models and are focusing on configuring how to call these deployed models. In LLMOps, your deployment strategies differ from traditional MLOps practices.

Azure Databricks offers managed endpoints for deploying LLMs, with built-in monitoring and logging to ensure model performance and reliability in production environments. Alternatively, you can deploy LLMs with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Services, and then use and configure them in Azure Databricks.

### Secure your system and implement responsible AI

Governance, compliance, and the responsible use of AI are critical in traditional MLOps. Especially in industries like finance and healthcare, where models need to adhere to strict regulatory requirements.

LLMOps introduces other challenges in this area:

- **Content safety** and moderation are necessary to prevent harmful information dissemination.
- **Jailbreaks** and security measures protect against adversarial attacks.
- Ensuring **transparency** and explainability builds trust by making model decisions understandable.
- **Continuous monitoring** and feedback loops maintain model accuracy, fairness, and safety over time.

When you address these challenges, you ensure that LLMs are developed and deployed responsibly, adhering to the highest standards of governance, compliance, and responsible AI practices.
