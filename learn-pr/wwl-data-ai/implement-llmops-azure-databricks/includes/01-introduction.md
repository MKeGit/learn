**LLMOps**, or **Large Language Model Operations**, is a new field focused on the deployment, management, and optimization of **Large Language Models** (**LLMs**) in real-world applications.

As the use of Generative AI and LLMs like GPT-4 grows across industries, LLMOps addresses the unique challenges of integrating these models into production environments.

Implementing LLMs in production includes model deployment, fine-tuning, monitoring, and ensuring ethical and responsible use of AI.

LLMOps bridges the gap between AI research and practical implementation, and enables organizations to harness the full potential of LLMs while maintaining performance, security, and compliance standards.
