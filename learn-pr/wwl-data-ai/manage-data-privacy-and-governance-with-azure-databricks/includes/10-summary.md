Implementing data privacy and governance with Azure Databricks is achieved by utilizing tools such as Microsoft Purview and Unity Catalog. Unity Catalog plays a crucial role in enhancing generative AI capabilities by ensuring AI models are built with high-quality, governed data. It acts as a centralized platform for managing and securing data assets across various environments, essential for data integrity and consistency. Unity Catalog provides detailed access control, protecting sensitive data and ensuring it’s only accessible to approved users, which is vital for the datasets used in training AI models. The platform also offers comprehensive data lineage and auditability, offering clear insight into the data’s origins and transformations, important for AI model development.
