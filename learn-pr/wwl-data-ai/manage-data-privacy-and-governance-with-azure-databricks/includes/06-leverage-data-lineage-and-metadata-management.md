Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance solution that enables data discovery, classification, and lineage tracking across various data sources. Unity Catalog, on the other hand, is a unified governance solution for all data assets in Azure Databricks, providing fine-grained access controls and metadata management.

Implementing data lineage and metadata management using Unity Catalog in Azure Databricks involves several steps to ensure that your data assets are well-organized, traceable, and secure. 

## Step 1: Set Up Unity Catalog
1. Create Unity Catalog Metastore:
    1. Go to the Azure Databricks workspace.
    2. Navigate to the "Data" tab.
    3. Select on "Create Metastore" and follow the prompts for setting up your Unity Catalog metastore.

2. Configure Permissions:
    1. Ensure appropriate permissions are set up for users and groups for access the Unity Catalog.
    2. Use the Data Governance tab to manage permissions and access control.

## Step 2: Register Data Sources
1. Register Tables and Views:
    1. In Unity Catalog, register your tables and views to enable metadata management.
    2. You can use the SQL command

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE <schema_name>.<table_name> AS SELECT * FROM <source_table>;
    ```

2. Register External Tables:
    1. For external data sources, register them in Unity Catalog for tracking metadata and lineage.
    2. Example command

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE <schema_name>.<external_table_name> USING <external_data_source> LOCATION '<path_to_external_data>';
   ```
## Step 3: Enable Data Lineage

1. Track Data Lineage:
    1. Unity Catalog automatically tracks data lineage for tables and views registered in the metastore.
    2. Ensure all data processing jobs and workflows are using the registered tables and views to maintain lineage tracking.

2. Visualize Data Lineage:
    1. Use the Azure Databricks UI to visualize data lineage.
    2. Navigate to the "Data" tab, select a table or view, and select on the "Lineage" tab to see the data flow and transformations.

## Step 4: Metadata Management

1. Define Metadata:
    1. Use Unity Catalog to define and manage metadata for your data assets.
    2. Example command to add metadata

    ```sql
    COMMENT ON TABLE <schema_name>.<table_name> IS '<description>';
    ```
2. Search and Discover Data:
    1. Utilize Unity Catalogâ€™s search functionality to find and discover data assets based on metadata.
    2. Use the search bar in the Azure Databricks UI under the "Data" tab.

## Step 5: Implement Security and Governance
1. Access Control:
    1. Implement fine-grained access control using Unity Catalog.
    2. Example command to grant permissions:

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <schema_name>.<table_name> TO <user_or_group>;
    ```
2. Data Masking and Row-Level Security:
    1. Apply data masking and row-level security to protect sensitive information.
    2. Example command for row-level security:    

    ```sql
    CREATE ROW ACCESS POLICY <policy_name> ON <schema_name>.<table_name> USING (<condition>);
    ```
## Step 6: Monitor and Audit
1. Enable Auditing:
    1. Enable auditing to track access and modifications to data assets.
    2. Use the audit logs provided by Azure Databricks and Unity Catalog to monitor activities.

2. Set Up Alerts:
    1. Configure alerts for specific events or thresholds to proactively manage data security and governance.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement data lineage and metadata management using Unity Catalog in Azure Databricks. This approach helps you maintain a well-organized, secure, and compliant data environment.
