In this module, we addressed the challenge of building, deploying, and scaling AI agents. Azure AI Agent Service solves several of these challenges, providing a fully managed environment for creating high-quality, extensible AI agents with minimal coding and infrastructure management.

The techniques learned in this module demonstrate several advantages, including automatic tool calling, secure data management, and flexible model selection. These features enable developers to focus on creating intelligent solutions while ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance. The business impact includes streamlined development processes, reduced operational overhead, and enhanced AI capabilities.

In this module, you learned about the purpose of Azure AI Agent Service, its key features, the setup process, and its integration capabilities with other Azure AI services. You explored how the service simplifies AI agent development through custom instructions, advanced tools, and secure data handling. Additionally, you learned how to set up the service and integrate it with Azure Functions for dynamic, event-driven applications.

After completing this module, you are now able to:

- Describe the purpose of AI agents
- Explain the key features of Azure AI Agent Service
- Build an agent using the Azure AI Agent Service
- Integrate an agent in the Azure AI Agent Service into your own app
