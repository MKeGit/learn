When evaluating the cost of a solution that replicates across multiple regions, you should calculate the cost as a multiple of the single-region cost relative to the number of replicas. There are two ways to calculate this based upon the type of throughput being used, standard provisioned throughput or autoscale.

```
1,000 x (1+5) = 6,000
```

The account would be billed for **6,000 RU/s** used at a per-hour rate.
