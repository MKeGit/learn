**LLM-as-a-judge** refers to the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the quality and performance of other LLMs and AI systems.

You can use LLM-as-a-judge to use the capabilities of LLMs to assess outputs based on predefined criteria, such as relevance, coherence, and accuracy. By acting as a judge, an LLM can provide consistent and scalable evaluations, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where human evaluation is impractical due to time or resource constraints.
