**LLM-as-a-judge** refers to the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the quality and performance of other LLMs and AI systems.

You can use LLM-as-a-judge to use the capabilities of LLMs to assess outputs based on predefined criteria, such as relevance, coherence, and accuracy. By acting as a judge, an LLM can provide consistent and scalable evaluations, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where human evaluation is impractical due to time or resource constraints.



Relevance Evaluation:

```md
Evaluate the relevance of the following response to the given query: [Query] - [Response]. Provide a score between 1 and 5, with 5 being highly relevant and 1 being not relevant at all.
```

Coherence Evaluation:

```md
Assess the coherence of the following paragraph. Does it logically flow from one sentence to the next? Provide a score between 1 and 5, with 5 being highly coherent and 1 being not coherent at all.
```

Accuracy Evaluation:

```md
Judge the accuracy of the following statement based on the provided context: [Context] - [Statement]. Provide a score between 1 and 5, with 5 being highly accurate and 1 being not accurate at all.
```

Fluency Evaluation:

```md
Evaluate the fluency of the following text. Does it read naturally and smoothly? Provide a score between 1 and 5, with 5 being highly fluent and 1 being not fluent at all.
