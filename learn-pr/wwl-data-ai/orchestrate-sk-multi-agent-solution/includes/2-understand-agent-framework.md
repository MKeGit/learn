Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK that enables developers to integrate AI models into their applications. Using the SDK, developers can create "plugins" to interface with the LLMs and perform various tasks. Semantic Kernel bridges the gap between AI and software development by offering tools to create AI-driven agents that can execute tasks, interact with APIs, and perform complex workflows.

## What is the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework?

The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework is a framework designed to help developers build AI-powered agents. These agents can process user inputs, make decisions, and execute tasks autonomously by leveraging large language models and traditional programming logic. The framework provides structured components for defining AI-driven workflows, enabling agents to interact with users, APIs, and external services.

### Core Concepts

- **Kernel** 

    The kernel is the central component of the Semantic Kernel. The kernel acts as the execution engine, managing AI interactions, function orchestration, and memory.

- **Agents**
    
    Agents are intelligent, AI-driven entities capable of reasoning and executing tasks. They use language models, functions, and memory to make decisions dynamically.

- **Plugins**

    Agents use plugins to perform specific tasks. Plugin functions enable agents to dynamically interact with external services or execute complex tasks.

- **History**

    Agents can maintain chat history across multiple interactions, allowing them to track previous interactions and adapt responses accordingly.

### Types of Agents

The Semantic Kernel Agent Framework supports several different types of agents.

- Chat Completion Agent
- OpenAI Assistant Agent
- Azure AI Agent
