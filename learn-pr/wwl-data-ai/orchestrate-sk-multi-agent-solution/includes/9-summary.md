In this module, you learned how to use the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework to create and manage multiple AI agents that work together to complete tasks. You saw how to define agents with different functions, connect them using AgentGroup, and automatically route user requests to the right agent. You also explored how agents can communicate with each other in a conversation, making AI interactions more dynamic and intelligent. With these skills, you can build flexible and scalable AI systems that handle a variety of tasks efficiently.
