In this module, you learned how the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework enables developers to build collaborative AI agents. You learned about agent selection, multi-agent collaboration, and termination strategies to understand how agents interact, process input, and determine conversation flow. You also learned how selection and termination strategies ensure efficiency and goal completion in agent-driven workflows. By applying these concepts and skills, you can leverage the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework to create dynamic, adaptable AI solutions that enhance user interactions and automate complex tasks.
