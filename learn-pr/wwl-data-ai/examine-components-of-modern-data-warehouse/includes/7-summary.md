Large-scale data analytics is a complex workload that can involve many different technologies. This module has provided a high-level overview of the key features of an analytics solution, and explored some of the Microsoft services that you can use to implement one.

In this module, you learned how to:

- Identify common elements of a large-scale data analytics solution
- Describe key features for data ingestion pipelines
- Identify common types of analytical data store
- Identify platform-as-a-service (PaaS) analytics services in Azure
- Provision Azure Synapse Analytics and use it to ingest, process, and query data
- Describe features of Microsoft Fabric - a software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution for data analytics
- Use Microsoft Fabric to ingest and analyze data

## Next steps
