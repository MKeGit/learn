Providing technical skills in data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and Cloud technologies will help ensure your students are well prepared for today’s job opportunities. Earning Microsoft Certifications augment a student’s existing degree and validate the skills needed to be successful across a variety of careers.

How you are going to teach those skills and certify your students is important to think about early in your planning. Three common types of curriculum adoption include:
- Standalone course: Implementation as a standalone course. The Microsoft content as a self-contained course consisting solely of Microsoft Official Curriculum (MOC).
- Integrated alongside a course: Delivered as an extracurricular course. Where the course includes MOC that is related to, but not core to, the school’s program curriculum. For example the course takes place during term breaks, outside regular class times, or a continuing or further education course.
- Integrated inside a course: The MOC content is embedded within a broader school curriculum where the learning objectives of the Microsoft curriculum and the academic course are aligned.
