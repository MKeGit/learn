Once you sign up for Microsoft Learn for Educators (MSLE), navigate to the [MSLE Portal](https://aka.ms/MSLEPort). The MSLE portal is a tool where you can review and update your profile. You can also enter upcoming courses from your teaching calendar, request a "certification exam voucher", explore and register for training events. Additionally, you can access the Learning Download Center (LDC) to explore the Microsoft curriculum and teaching materials.
