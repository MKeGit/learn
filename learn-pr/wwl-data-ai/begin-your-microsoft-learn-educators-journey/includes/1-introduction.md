Microsoft Learn for Educators is committed to empowering every faculty member with the resources needed to equip students with cutting-edge technical skills. These in-demand skills, from cloud computing to AI and beyond, are aligned to industry-recognized Microsoft Credentials and will set graduates up for real-world success. 

To support the delivery of Microsoft's ready-to-teach curriculum, we also provide faculty with access to additional resources. These resources include discounted certification exams and discounted or free practice exams, curriculum integration support, course delivery prep sessions led by Microsoft Technical Trainers, [Microsoft Virtual Training Days](https://aka.ms/mvtdevents), and entry into our global Teams-based community of educators, supported by Microsoft community managers, committed to helping students succeed.  

We offer two distinct program options to join MSLE: Engage as an individual educator or nominate your entire institution to participate in the MSLE program.

The individual educator option is ideal for faculty who seeks to enhance their students technical proficiency and ensure their students are real-world ready. 

The institution option is specially tailored for academic institutions with multiple faculty members teaching technical skills with Microsoft curriculum that align to industry recognized credentials.
