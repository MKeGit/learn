If you want to minimize the amount of downtime during the migration, you can use the SQL Server Always On availability group (AG) feature to extend an on-premises database into the cloud. 

A [distributed availability group (AG)](/azure/azure-sql/migration-guides/virtual-machines/sql-server-distributed-availability-group-migrate-standalone-instance) can be used to migrate a standalone instance of SQL Server or an Always On availability group to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs).  

If you're migrating a database (or multiple databases) from a standalone instance, using a distributed AG is a straightforward solution that doesn't require either a Windows Server Failover Cluster or an availability group listener on the source or target. However, if you're migrating an availability group, both a cluster and a listener are required on the source and target.

You can use Transact-SQL to add a replica of the database using your already existing on-premises SQL Server using the **Add Azure Replica** wizard. It must have an existing Always On availability group and have an existing connection between your on-premises network and Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Add Azure Replica** wizard only works with Azure Virtual Machines running in classic deployment model. The best practice is to create virtual machines with Resource Manager, as a result you can only add a replica using Transact-SQL.
