Discover the advantages of deploying your applications on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which offers streamlined scalability, robust orchestration, and integration with other Azure services for modern cloud-native applications.

Imagine you’re part of a fast-growing development team building a microservices-based application. Your team needs a reliable solution to manage and scale containerized workloads across multiple environments without compromising on efficiency or control. You want to use Kubernetes for container orchestration while taking advantage of Azure’s comprehensive ecosystem to optimize your deployments.

The topics covered in this module include:
- Explore the features and benefits of Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Create an Azure Container Resource to store build images and integrate it with AKS.
- Deploy and manage containerized applications using AKS.

By the end of this module, you can understand how Azure Kubernetes Service simplifies deploying and managing containerized applications, enabling you to confidently orchestrate your workloads in a scalable and efficient way.
