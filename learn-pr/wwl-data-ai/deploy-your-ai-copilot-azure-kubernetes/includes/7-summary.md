In this module, you learned how to develop, containerize, and deploy an AI-powered vector search application on Azure. Starting with implementing vector search capabilities for your app, you then created and configured an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to securely store your container images. Finally, you deployed your application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Throughout the module, you gained hands-on experience in building cloud-native applications, preparing you to deploy robust AI solutions with efficiency and reliability.
