AI speech capabilities enable us to manage home and auto systems with voice instructions, get answers from computers for spoken questions, generate captions from audio, and much more.

To enable this kind of interaction, the AI system must support two capabilities:

- **Speech recognition** - the ability to detect and interpret spoken input
- **Speech synthesis** - the ability to generate spoken output

**Azure AI Speech** provides speech to text and text to speech capabilities through speech recognition and synthesis. You can use prebuilt and custom Speech service models for a variety of tasks, from transcribing audio to text with high accuracy, to identifying speakers in conversations, creating custom voices, and more. Next you'll learn how AI speech capabilities work.
