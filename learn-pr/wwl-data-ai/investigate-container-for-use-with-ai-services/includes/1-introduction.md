Containers enable you to host Azure AI services either on-premises or in Azure. For example, if your application uses sensitive data in an on-premises SQL Server to call an Azure AI services service, you can deploy Azure AI services in containers on the same network. Now your data can stay on your local network and not be passed to the cloud. Deploying Azure AI services in a container on-premises will also decrease the latency between the service and your local data, which can improve performance.

In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Create containers for reuse.
- Deploy to a container and secure a container.
- Consume Azure AI services from a container.
