In this module, you learned about the different options for building Windows applications and how to choose the best option based on project requirements. The content introduces Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, and WinUI as frameworks for Windows development. It explains the features and benefits of each framework, including customization, rich functionality, high performance, and compatibility with touch devices. Each option has its own strengths and benefits, so it's important to consider your specific needs when choosing the best framework for your next Windows application.

The main takeaways from this module are:

- WPF is a mature framework that offers customization, rich functionality, and high performance. It's suitable for enterprise applications and can be deployed through the Microsoft Store.
- Windows Forms is a UI framework with a drag-and-drop visual designer, making it easy to rapidly create desktop client apps. It's suitable for applications that require a responsive and easy-to-update interface.
- WinUI and Windows App SDK enable the creation of modern and native Windows apps with Fluent design and high performance. It's the premier choice for developers to build apps for Windows. WinUI is perfect for applications that need to follow the latest design system guidance and work seamlessly with touch and pen input.

Together, WinUI, the Windows App SDK, and WPF represent the best path forward for developers creating modern native desktop applications on Windows. Use WinUI when the feature set meets the needs of the application, especially for graphics, media, and consumer scenarios. Use WPF to gain access to the large ecosystem of third-party controls and libraries available, especially for line-of-business applications.
