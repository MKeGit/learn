  questions:
  - content: 'The AzureML Python SDK allowed us to connect and interact with our Azure Machine Learning studio workspace by ...'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Providing a config.json file that specified the details to connect to the appropriate workspace.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The config.json file species the subscription_id, resource_group, and workspace_name of the Machine Learning studio workspace.
    - content: 'Providing a connection string within a connection cell in the Jupyter notebook.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. A connection string was not used for authentication to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.
    - content: 'Using our Azure credentials which were passed in transparently when accessing the Jupyter notebook.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The AzureML Python SDK must explicitly reference a workspace configuration from a file (config.json).
  - content: 'The AzureML Python SDK allowed us to provision a compute instance in our Azure Machine Learning Studio workspace.  That instance could then be referenced in Python code to submit AutoML tasks to run on that machine as a target.'
    choices: 
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. The AzureML Python SDK can automate various tasks including provisioning a compute instance and submitting experiments.
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The AzureML Python SDK can provision compute instances and submit experiments to run on those instances.
  - content: 'Azure AutoML allows you to tune hyperparameters to automatically discover optimal settings for your model.'
    choices: 
    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. Azure AutoML can use default hyperparameter values or allow for sweeping of various hyperparameter values to discover optimal setting through iteration.
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. Azure AutoML can use default hyperparameter values or allow for sweeping of various hyperparameter values to discover optimal setting through iteration.
