Azure Machine Learning is a platform for creating and managing the end-to-end life cycle of machine learning systems. Azure Machine Learning is **framework agnostic**, giving you the flexibility to work with the technologies you prefer, such as *TensorFlow*, *PyTorch*, *ONNX*, *MLFlow*, and *Scikit-learn*.

## Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning enables users familiar with Machine Learning frameworks to quickly train and deploy models using code, while giving others powerful visual tools. All your training scripts, models, logs, and computes are centralized in a shared Workspace in Azure Machine Learning, which assists you in every step of building and deploying machine learning systems—meaning you can focus on models while Azure Machine Learning does the rest.

Azure Machine Learning has a comprehensive suite of features to support logging, monitoring, and governance of datasets and models. These features ensure your models are performing as intended and are effectively communicated to stakeholders.

## What is Azure Machine Learning studio?

Azure Machine Learning studio is a browser-based service that provides no-code and code-first solutions to visually create, train, and manage models through a web UI. Azure Machine Learning studio allows *Python* and *R* SDK to seamlessly integrate with the natively supported *Jupyter Notebooks* for collaborative notes and coding. Data within Azure Machine Learning studio is simple to manage with intuitive data visualization and AI-assisted image or text labeling features.

## Creating a model

Models can be created in Azure Machine Learning in several ways. Training can take place on a local machine or the Azure cloud, such as a virtual machine or compute cluster.

### AutoML

*Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)* automates creating the best machine learning models, helping users find the best model for their data—no matter their data science expertise. **Specializing in classification, regression, and time-series forecasting**, AutoML experiments with different features, algorithms, and parameters depending on the task—then provides scores on models it thinks are the best fit. These models can then be exported to an ONNX format that can run on various platforms and devices. AutoML’s versatility and speed mean that both experienced and novice data scientists often use it as a starting point.

In the following image, there's an overview of the AutoML pipeline building and recommending a model.

## Compute

The computing resources you need for your Machine Learning environment can be allocated or attached through Azure Machine Learning. From the compute that powers your Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, to the clusters you use for training and the kubernetes clusters you deploy to for production inferencing at scale. Your compute resources can be managed through Azure Machine Learning.

## Managing data

With Azure Machine Learning, you can streamline and collaboratively work on the time-intensive process of data preparation and ingestion. The platform smoothly integrates with *Azure Synapse*, *Azure Databricks*, and a suite of other Azure services to assist data engineering pipelines to extract, transform, and load (ETL) raw data into datastores.

### Datastores and labeling

Azure Machine Learning securely stores your raw data in the datastore. You don’t have to rely on external sources for your scripts, and you can experiment on your training sets without risking the integrity of the original raw data. Once stored, you can clean, transform, and label data to create training sets from the datastore. Azure Machine Learning offers tools to help label tabular, image, and text data—with built-in machine learning systems that can suggest labels or fully automate data labeling.
