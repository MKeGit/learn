The DeepStream 6.0 `container-builder` package can build cross-platform container images. You'll need to use this capability to build a container that's compatible with the ARM64 CPU on your target NVIDIA embedded device.

Complete the following steps on an x86-based host machine that has DeepStream 6.0 Graph Composer with Docker installed.

1. To begin, you must install the `qemu-user-static` and `binfmt-support` packages. The packages are dependencies that are needed for cross-platform support in Docker. To perform this step, run the following commands in a terminal on the host:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install qemu-user-static binfmt-support
    ```

1. When installation is finished, run the following commands on the host to configure cross-platform support in Docker:

    ```bash
    sudo docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset --persistent yes --credential yes 
    ```

1. Next, you'll create a `container-builder` configuration that will produce an ARM64 based container to support the deepstream-test4 graph.  To begin, go to */opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/deepstream-test4* and open the `ds_test4_container_builder_jetson.yaml` file with:

    ```Bash
        cd /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/deepstream-test4
        sudo vi ds_test4_container_builder_jetson.yaml
    ```
    
    The contents of the unmodified `ds_test4_container_builder_jetson.yaml` file are shown below:

    > Here are some tips for using the vi editor when you edit the *ds_test4_container_builder_jetson.yaml* file:

    >- To enter insert mode, select **i**. Then, you can make changes.
    >- To exit insert mode and return to normal mode, select **Esc**.
    >- To save the file and quit, select **x**, and then select **Enter**.
    >- To save the file, select **w**, and then select **Enter**.
    >- To quit vi, enter **Quit**, and then select **Enter**.

    Take note of the very last line of this file as it will require a modification:
    ```
    image_name: <docker-container-registry>:deepstream-test4-jetson
    ```

    Update this section to look like the following:
    ```
    image_name: deepstream-test4-jetson
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > If you do not modify this section, attempts to build the cross-platform image in later steps will produce the following error: `ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`

    Take note that this specification uses a base image from nvcr.io and copies in the `deepstream-test4.yaml` and `parameters.yaml` files. The image entrypoint starts the deepstream-test4 graph and overrides it with the values present in `parameters.yaml`.  For this reason, we also need to update this file before we actually build the container.

1. Return to the directory of the *deepstream-test4* reference graphs and edit the *parameters.yaml* file:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/deepstream-test4
    sudo vi parameters.yaml
    ```

    Change the value of `msg-broker-proto-lib` to `/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib/libnvds_azure_edge_proto.so`.

    Also, change the value of `msg-conv-payload-type` to `1`. This parameter controls how the resulting message output is formatted. If you don't change this parameter, the output uses a hard-coded format that's provided in the NVIDIA samples. The format might not represent your object detection classes if you update the model used in `NvDsInferVideo`.

    The final contents of *parameters.yaml* should look like the following example:

1. Build the cross-platform image on the host machine by running the following command in a terminal:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/deepstream-test4
    sudo container_builder -c ds_test4_container_builder_jetson.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/config/target_aarch64.yaml
    ```

    After the code runs successfully, output that contains the message `Successfully tagged deepstream-test4-jetson:latest` appears.

1. Now, you're ready to publish this image to the container registry you created in the previous module. Run the following code in a terminal on the host to tag the image with a name that follows the format you used earlier. For \<Login Server\>, use the URL of your container registry.

    ```bash
    sudo docker tag deepstream-test4-jetson <Login Server>/deepstream_test4_jetson:v1
    ```

1. With your image now properly tagged, push the image to your container registry in Azure by executing the following command in a terminal on the host. For \<Login Server\>, use the URL of your container registry.

    ```bash
    sudo docker push <Login Server>/deepstream_test4_jetson:v1
    ```

With your cross-platform image now published to the Azure container registry, you're ready to provision your NVIDIA embedded hardware for the IoT Edge runtime and deploy this workload as an IoT Edge module.
