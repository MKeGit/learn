  questions:
  - content: 'In this module, our image data was referenced using a datastore that attached to an existing ...'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Azure Blob Storage in an Azure Storage account'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. An existing Azure Blob Storage resource was referenced by our datastore.
    - content: 'Azure Synapse Analytics data pipeline'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While it's possible to reference data using an Azure Synapse Analytics data pipeline, this strategy wasn't used in this module.
    - content: 'File Share in an Azure Storage Account.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. While it's possible to reference data using a File Share in an Azure Storage Account, this strategy wasn't used in this module.
  - content: 'ML-assisted labeling was not required in this module,  how might it be beneficial to a data labeling project?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'ML-assisted labeling creates a model that can pre-label data in new image samples that may be reviewed later by team members for accuracy.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct. This feature is a great benefit that can reduce the time required to label image data in new samples.
    - content: 'ML-assisted labeling can determine objects in an image using an existing model that detects a variety of common objects.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The behavior described isn't a functionality of ML-assisted labeling.
    - content: 'Allows you to submit unlabeled to be labeled by a third party service that employs human labelers.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The behavior described isn't a functionality of ML-assisted labeling. 
  - content: 'The reason we labeled 10 images in our dataset was to satisfy the following requirement:'
    choices: 
    - content: '10 is the total number of images that make up our dataset'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. The unlabeled dataset contains over 200 unlabeled image samples.
    - content: '10 is the maximum number of images that can be used to train an object detection model.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Incorrect. We can train using a large number of labeled samples that far exceeds 10.
    - content: 'Azure ML Studio Object Detection Experiments require a minimum of 10 labeled samples in order to successfully train our object detection model'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct.  If we supply fewer images, we'll receive an error when attempting to train an object detection model using our exported dataset.
