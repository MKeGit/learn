Microsoft Fabric offers three key features to help you manage your machine learning models: notebooks, experiments, and models. 

To train machine learning models with the open-source framework of your choice, you can use notebooks.

To keep a clear overview of your work and easily compare the models you've trained, you can use experiments and their runs.

When you've trained a model that you want to use to generate predictions, you can save the model in the Microsoft Fabric workspace.
