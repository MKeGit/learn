Consider the following best practices when implementing real-time dashboards in Microsoft Fabric.

- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Keep the dashboard simple and avoid clutter.
    - Use clear labels for tiles and visuals. 
    - Use more pages for navigation or subject area when necessary.
- **Relevance**: Ensure that the data displayed is relevant to the dashboard's purpose and the audience's needs.
- **Refresh Rate**: Set an appropriate refresh rate to ensure data is up to date without overloading the system.
    - Consult with your users to ensure refresh rates are within expectations.
- **Accessibility**: Design dashboards that are accessible to all users, including those with viewer permissions.
- **Interactivity**: Include features that allow users to interact with the data, such as filters and drill-down capabilities.
    - Elicit feedback regularly to ensure that the reports continue to provide value.
    - As users become more familiar with the products, the introduction of new features can enhance their productivity.
    - Use Copilot when possible to increase productivity.
- **Performance**: Optimize queries and visuals for performance to ensure a smooth user experience.
    - Include parameters, which apply filters at the query and are executed during the rendering of the Real-Time Dashboard.
    - Don't query more than you use in the visualization to meet the customer requirements.
- **Security**: Implement appropriate security measures. 
    - Protect sensitive data.
    - Remember, Fabric is a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, and it's critical that you properly manage who has access to the system (*authentication*), and what they have access too (*authorization*).
- **Testing**: Regularly test the dashboard for functionality and performance issues.
    - Testing should include user-acceptance testing and feedback loops.
