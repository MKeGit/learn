This tutorial provides a brief introduction to KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries. KQL is a powerful query language used in Microsoft Fabric to analyze large volumes of data and to create querysets for consumption in Real-Time Dashboards and Power BI reports. This includes the ability to use Copilot to ask questions about your data, which in turn, will create the KQL code for you. 

The tutorial covers the basics of writing KQL and T-SQL queries against a KQL Database in Microsoft Fabric, including selecting data, filtering data, and aggregating data. By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a good understanding of how to get started with KQL queries in Microsoft Fabric and begin analyzing your data effectively.
By following these best practices, you can optimize your queries for better performance and efficiency. We'll discuss techniques such as using the right data types, applying indexing, and avoiding unnecessary functions. This training helps you become more proficient in writing efficient KQL queries.

In this training session, we'll explore advanced features that can enhance your productivity. These features include shortcuts, automation tools, and collaboration options.
