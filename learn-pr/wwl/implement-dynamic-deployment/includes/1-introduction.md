Even with the ability to reset the existing Windows image with Autopilot, sometimes even that isn’t necessary, especially with new devices purchased from an OEM. A new device typically starts with a fresh install of Windows, and what’s typically needed is the correct edition deployed (such as Windows Enterprise or Education), correct configuration and apps. When this is the case, dynamic provisioning can further simplify deployments.

Dynamic provisioning uses a number of transforms to achieve this objective.

| Microsoft Entra join with automatic MDM enrollment | Using Microsoft Entra join with automatic MDM enrollment, users enter their work or school account details and their device is automatically joined to Microsoft Entra ID and enrolled in MDM. The user’s device is then configured per the organization’s MDM policies. |
