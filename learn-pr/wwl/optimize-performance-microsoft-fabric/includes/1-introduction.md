This module covers the broad article of optimizing data movement within Microsoft Fabric to include:

- Building delta Lake tables for efficient analytics
- Transitioning to Fabric Data Factory from Azure Data Factory or Azure Synapse pipelines
- Utilizing Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric
- Securing information in Microsoft Fabric.

Imagine you're a data engineer at a large retail company. Your team is responsible for managing and optimizing the company's data lakehouse, which is built on Delta Lake. The data stored in the lakehouse is used by analysts across the company to generate insights and make data-driven decisions. However, you notice that the performance of the lakehouse has been degrading over time, leading to slower query times, or increased costs. You might be tasked with transitioning your data pipelines from Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse to Fabric Data Factory, a new SaaS solution. Additionally, you need to utilize Apache Spark for large-scale data analytics and secure your data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.

The articles covered in this module include:

- Optimizing Delta Lake Tables with V-Order and Write Optimization
- Maximizing Data Movement Throughput with Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse and Fabric Data Factory
- Understanding and Configuring Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric
- Securing, Monitoring, and Designing Data Warehouses in Microsoft Fabric
- Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

By the end of this module, you're able to optimize Delta Lake tables for efficient analytics, transition your data pipelines to Fabric Data Factory, utilize Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric for large-scale data analytics, and secure your data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.
