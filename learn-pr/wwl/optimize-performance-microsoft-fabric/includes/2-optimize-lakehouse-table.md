Delta Lake table optimization is crucial for ensuring efficient analytics. This guide covers key concepts and configurations for optimizing Delta Lake tables, focusing on V-Order.

## What is V-Order?

V-Order is a write-time optimization for the Parquet file format that enhances read performance. It applies sorting, row group distribution, dictionary encoding, and compression to Parquet files, resulting in:

- **Faster Reads**: Up to 50% faster in some scenarios.
- **Better Compression**: Up to 50% more compression.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced network, disk, and CPU resource usage.

## Controlling V-Order Writes

V-Order can be controlled at different levels:

- **Session Level**: Use `spark.sql.parquet.vorder.enabled` to enable or disable V-Order for all writes in a session.
- **Table Properties**: Use `TBLPROPERTIES("delta.parquet.vorder.enabled" = "true")` to enable V-Order for specific tables.
- **Dataframe Writer Option**: Use `.option("parquet.vorder.enabled", "true")` to control V-Order for specific write operations.

### Example Commands

Some example commands to get you started are presented including how to enable V-Order within a session, create a table with V-Order, and control V-Order on writes.

```tsql
 %%sql
-- Enable V-Order in Session
    SET spark.sql.parquet.vorder.enabled = TRUE;

-- Create a table  with V-Order
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT
) USING parquet TBLPROPERTIES("delta.parquet.vorder.enabled" = "true");

```

### Example writes optimization commands

Optimize Write reduces the number of small files and increases individual file sizes, enhancing performance for analytical workloads. It's enabled by default in Microsoft Fabric.

## What is Optimize Write?

Analytical workloads on Big Data processing engines such as Apache Spark perform most efficiently when using standardized larger file sizes. The relationship between file size, the number of files, the number of Spark workers, and its configurations play a critical role in performance. Ingesting data into data lake tables might have the inherited characteristic of constantly writing lots of small files; this scenario is commonly known as the "small file problem."

**Optimize Write** is a feature in Delta Lake on Microsoft Fabric and Azure Synapse Analytics within the Apache Spark engine that reduces the number of files written and aims to increase the individual file size of the written data. The target file size can be adjusted per workload requirements using configurations.

The feature is enabled by default in Microsoft Fabric Runtime for Apache Spark. In many cases if you have thousands of small files from items like IoT sensors, then it's better to have a separate job to consolidate them into larger files before bringing them into the Fabric structure.


```python
    
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").option("parquet.vorder.enabled", "true").saveAsTable("mytable");

```

### Merge Optimization

The Low Shuffle merge optimization improves the performance of the Delta Lake `MERGE` command by excluding unmodified rows from expensive shuffling operations.

## Delta Table Maintenance

Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance:

Bin-Compaction: Use the `OPTIMIZE` command to merge small files into larger ones.
Vacuuming: Use the `VACUUM` command to remove obsolete files.

- **Optimize table with `VORDER`**

```tsql
%%sql
OPTIMIZE myTable VORDER;

```

- **`VACUUM` data table**

```tsql
%%sql
VACUUM myTable;

```

As Delta tables change, performance and storage cost efficiency tend to degrade for the following reasons:

- **Data Skew**: New data added to the table might skew data.
- **Small Files**: Batch and streaming data ingestion rates might bring in many small files.
- **Read Overhead**: Update and delete operations eventually create read overhead; Parquet files are immutable by design, so Delta tables add new Parquet files with the changeset, further amplifying the issues imposed by the first two items.
- **Obsolete Files**: No longer needed data files and log files available in the storage.
