  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What is the primary purpose of V-Order in Delta Lake table optimization?"
    choices:
    - content: "V-Order is used to increase the number of small files for efficient data storage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. V-Order doesn't increase the number of small files, it enhances read performance by applying sorting, row group distribution, dictionary encoding, and compression to Parquet files."
    - content: "V-Order is used to disable write-time optimization for the Parquet file format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. V-Order is a write-time optimization for the Parquet file format, not a tool to disable it."
    - content: "V-Order is a write-time optimization for the Parquet file format that enhances read performance."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. V-Order applies sorting, row group distribution, dictionary encoding, and compression to Parquet files, enhancing read performance."
  - content: "What strategies can be used to enhance throughput in Fabric Data Factory?"
    choices:
    - content: "Limiting the number of copy activities running in parallel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Running multiple copy activities in parallel can actually increase throughput."
    - content: "Avoiding the use of surrogate keys"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The use of surrogate keys can help separate source data from warehouse data, which can enhance throughput."
    - content: "Profiling the data, using a ForEach loop for parallel copy activities, and employing traditional warehouse techniques"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These strategies can help maximize data movement throughput in Fabric Data Factory."
  - content: "What is the primary function of a head node in a Spark pool?"
    choices:
    - content: "It performs the actual data processing tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The executor performs data processing tasks by processes on worker nodes, not the head node."
    - content: "It stores the data to be processed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The head node doesn't store data; it coordinates distributed processes."
    - content: "It coordinates distributed processes through a driver program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The head node in a Spark pool coordinates distributed processes through a driver program."
  - content: "What is the purpose of item permissions in Microsoft Fabric?"
    choices:
    - content: "Item permissions are used to grant access to all items within a workspace."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Item permissions aren't for granting access to all items within a workspace, that's the role of workspace roles."
    - content: "Item permissions are used to restrict users from connecting using the SQL connection string."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Item permissions, specifically the 'Read' permission, actually allow users to connect using the SQL connection string."
    - content: "Item permissions are used to grant access to individual warehouses, enabling sharing of a single data warehouse for downstream consumption."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Item permissions in Microsoft Fabric are used to control access at an individual warehouse level."
  - content: "What is the main purpose of using Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric?"
    choices:
    - content: "To launch the exercise"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Launching the exercise isn't the main purpose of using Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric."
    - content: "To enable a Fabric trial license"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Enabling a Fabric trial license isn't the main purpose of using Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric."
    - content: "To analyze and visualize data from files in lakehouse"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The main purpose of using Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric is to analyze and visualize data from files in lakehouse."
