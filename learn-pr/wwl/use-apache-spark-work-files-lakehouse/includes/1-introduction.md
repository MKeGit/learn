Apache Spark is an open-source framework for large-scale data processing and analytics. Apache Spark is integrated into Microsoft Fabric to provide a big data platform for analytics.

Fabric Spark clusters provide a powerful, in-memory distributed framework for at-scale data processing. In Microsoft Fabric, Spark can be used together with other analytics services such as lakehouses, notebooks, and data pipelines.

In this module you explore how to use Spark with notebooks to ingest, process, and analyze data in a Fabric lakehouse.
