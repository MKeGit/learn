  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to use Apache Spark to explore data interactively in Microsoft Fabric. What should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Spark job definition."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Spark job definition will run Spark code, but is not the best choice for interactive analytics."
    - content: "A pipeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A pipeline is not an interactive Spark environment."
    - content: "A notebook."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Notebooks enable you to run Spark code interactively."
  - content: "You need to use Spark to analyze data in a CSV file. What's the simplest way to accomplish this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load the file into a dataframe."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can load data from files in many formats, including CSV, into a Spark dataframe."
    - content: "Import the data into a table in a warehouse."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You do not need to load the data into a warehouse in order to analyze it with Spark."
    - content: "Convert the data to Parquet format."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While you could load the data into Spark from a Parquet file, you do not need to convert the data from CSV format in order to use it in Spark."
  - content: "Which format is used to store data as lakehouse tables in Microsoft Fabric?"
    choices:
    - content: "`Comma-separated-values (CSV)`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. CSV is a common format for delimited text data, but it's not used for tables in Fabric."
    - content: "`Avro`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Avro is a common file format in big data processing, but it's not used for tables in Fabric."
    - content: "`Delta`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Tables in a Fabric lakehouse are based on Delta Lake technology, which uses an extended format of Parquet files known as Delta."
