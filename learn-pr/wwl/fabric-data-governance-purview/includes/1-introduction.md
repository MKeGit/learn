Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data platform with advanced analytical tools for organizations that need a single solution for their data storage, movement, transformation, and reporting. When you have a large volume of data, some of which is highly sensitive, you must ensure that it's protected, carefully monitored, discoverable, and compliant with all the applicable legislation in the regions where your organization operates. Data governance is the set of techniques and tools that you use to implement these requirements.

Microsoft Fabric includes many data governance features as is. You can also use Microsoft Purview to scan your Fabric tenant for a complete solution that can help your organization govern, protect, and manage your entire data estate.
