In this module, we explored how lakehouses fit into a data analytics solution using Microsoft Fabric. Lakehouses provide data engineers and analysts with the combined benefits of data lake storage and a relational data warehouse. You can use a lakehouse as the basis of an end-to-end data analytics solution that includes data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and visualization.

Fabric lakehouses provide value as a Software-as-a-Service data store that provides all of the benefits with less administration.
