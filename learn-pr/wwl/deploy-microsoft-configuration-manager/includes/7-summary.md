Imaging has been a traditional method for deploying operating system (OS) images to devices, and while newer solutions have emerged that don't require imaging, some scenarios still call for it. The Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) is an on-premises solution for creating images and deploying the OS to devices either as a stand-alone tool or used with Configuration Manager. MDT can create a custom image with OS configurations and applications included in the image itself. While MDT is used for deployments, it doesn't provide day-to-day client management capabilities. Configuration Manager and MDT share many of the same deployment capabilities, including Task Sequences. Unlike MDT, Configuration Manager also provides features for managing app and OS updates, inventory, and reporting.
