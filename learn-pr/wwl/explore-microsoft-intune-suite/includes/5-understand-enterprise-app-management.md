Enterprise App Management in the Microsoft Intune Suite gives IT professionals the tools they need to secure, deploy, and manage corporate applications across devices, whether company-owned or personal. This feature ensures that applications are deployed consistently and securely, with detailed controls over app configuration, access, and updates.

## How itâ€™s used in Modern IT

Organizations today are heavily dependent on productivity apps such as Microsoft 365, line-of-business (LOB) applications, and third-party software. IT teams need a streamlined way to ensure apps are available and secure across a wide variety of devices and platforms, especially in hybrid work environments where employees often use personal devices to access corporate resources.

## App Protection Policies in Microsoft Intune

**App Protection Policies** in Microsoft Intune are essential for protecting corporate data within apps, especially in **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** scenarios where the device itself isn't managed by the organization. These policies focus on controlling how data is accessed and shared within apps, ensuring that corporate data remains secure, even on personal devices.

#### Key features

- **Data Protection**: App protection policies can enforce encryption, restrict copy-paste functions, and prevent data backup to personal services like iCloud. This ensures corporate data remains isolated within the app.
  
- **Conditional Access**: Conditional access rules allow IT admins to set conditions for app usage based on factors like device compliance, ensuring that only approved devices can access sensitive data.

- **Granular Control**: Policies allow administrators to specify what apps can do with corporate data, such as preventing the sharing of information between unmanaged and managed apps or ensuring that data remains within the company's ecosystem.


## Real-world use case

These policies are especially useful for organizations that implement a **Zero Trust security model**, as they help limit data leakage and ensure that sensitive information is protected, even on unmanaged devices. By managing data at the app level, organizations can maintain control over corporate assets without requiring full device enrollment.

## Benefits of Enterprise App Management

The Enterprise App Management provides the following benefits:

- **Streamlined app management**: You can save time and reduce complexity by streamlining the app management process. Discover and add apps directly from the Intune console.
- **Stay current with updates**: You're able to keep apps up to date by easily creating apps for the new versions of products as they're available in the catalog.

When you add an Enterprise App Catalog app, Intune prefills the following installation details:

- Commands to install and uninstall the app
- Time required to install the app
- Option to allow app uninstallation by the end user
- Installation and device restart behavior
- Return codes to indicate post-installation behavior
- Whether to install the app for system or user
  

Microsoft Intune prefills the detection rules that devices must meet before the app is installed:

- File size
- File version
- Registry

Also, Intune prefills the requirements that devices must meet before the app is installed:

- Windows OS architecture required
- Minimum OS required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends using the pre-populated fields containing specific commands and rules, however you can modify the pre-populated fields if needed.

You can also configure app-specific rules used to detect the presence of the Enterprise App Catalog app. You can choose to either manually configure the detection rules or use a custom script to detect the presence of the app before installing the app.

## Self-updating apps

The Enterprise App Catalog includes apps that self-update. Intune ensures the app is at least at a target minimum version, and considers the app installed if the detected version of the app is at or above the minimum version. Self-updating apps update on client devices based on the vendor's process. Intune reports the version of the app detected on the device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Self-updating apps may require that your tenant has network rules configured to allow an update from the app vendor.
