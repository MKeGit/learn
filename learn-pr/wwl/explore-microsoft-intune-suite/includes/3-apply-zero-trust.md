### Applying Zero Trust security using the Microsoft Intune Suite

**Zero Trust** is a security framework that assumes threats can come from anywhere, both inside and outside the network. It requires continuous verification of users, devices, and applications before granting access to corporate resources. The **Microsoft Intune Suite** plays a key role in implementing a Zero Trust security model by integrating with other Microsoft security solutions to enforce strict access control, device compliance, and identity verification.

### How Zero Trust works in Modern IT

With the increasing adoption of remote and hybrid work environments, corporate networks are more dispersed than ever. This makes traditional perimeter-based security models insufficient. **Zero Trust** assumes that any device or user could be compromised, so access must be continuously evaluated. The Intune Suite helps organizations secure devices, users, and applications with a comprehensive approach to ensure that only trusted entities can access critical resources.

### Key features for implementing Zero Trust with Microsoft Intune

- **Conditional Access Policies**:  
   **Conditional Access** integrates with **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory) to continuously evaluate risks associated with users, devices, locations, and apps. Access is only granted when specific conditions are met, such as the device being compliant with company policies, the user being authenticated via multifactor authentication (MFA), or access requests coming from secure locations.

- **Device Compliance Policies**:  
   Intune enables IT administrators to enforce device compliance rules, ensuring that only secure and managed devices can access corporate data. These policies can enforce encryption, require passcodes, and check for the latest security updates. Devices that don’t meet the compliance criteria are automatically restricted from accessing corporate resources.

- **App Protection Policies**:  
   App protection policies allow IT to enforce security settings at the application level, even on unmanaged devices (BYOD). These policies ensure that corporate data within apps is encrypted, isolated from personal data, and shared only within approved channels. This helps prevent data leakage, particularly in environments where personal devices are used for work.

- **Endpoint Privilege Management**:  
   A key feature of the Intune Suite, **Endpoint Privilege Management** enforces least-privilege access by granting temporary administrative privileges for specific tasks. This minimizes the risk of privilege escalation attacks and reduces the attack surface by ensuring that users only have the access they need for specific tasks.

- **Integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**:  
   Microsoft Defender for Endpoint works in tandem with Intune to provide threat detection and response capabilities. Devices are continuously monitored for threats, and actions can be taken automatically to block compromised devices from accessing corporate resources.

### How Intune enables Zero Trust

- **Continuous Authentication and Access Control**:  
   By using **Conditional Access** and multifactor authentication, Intune ensures that users and devices are continuously authenticated and verified before accessing sensitive data. This eliminates the need to trust any user or device by default, providing a more robust security posture.

- **Granular Device and App Management**:  
   With **Intune’s compliance policies** and **app protection policies**, organizations can ensure that every device and app accessing corporate data adheres to strict security standards. Even in a BYOD environment, data is protected without requiring full device management.

- **Threat Response and Mitigation**:  
   Intune integrates with **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** to enable real-time threat monitoring. If a device is compromised or becomes non-compliant, access to corporate data can be immediately revoked, helping to mitigate security risks.

- **Least-Privilege Access**:  
   **Endpoint Privilege Management** ensures that users only have the necessary access for specific tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized actions and keeps the network safer by enforcing strict privilege controls.

### Real-world use case

A financial institution with a global workforce deploys a Zero Trust model using **Microsoft Intune**. Employees working remotely must authenticate through **multifactor authentication** before accessing the corporate network, and their devices must meet the organization’s security standards, such as encryption and compliance with the latest security patches. 

With **Conditional Access** policies in place, only compliant devices are allowed to access financial systems, and all devices are monitored in real-time for potential threats through **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**. Any suspicious activity or non-compliance results in immediate restrictions, ensuring that sensitive financial data remains secure, regardless of where or how employees access it.
