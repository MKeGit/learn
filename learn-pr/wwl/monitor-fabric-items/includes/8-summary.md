In this module, you learned about the Lambda approach to monitoring data ingestion which involves a speed layer and a batch layer. The speed layer, represented by Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric, provides a solution for ingesting, processing, and analyzing streaming data. The batch layer, represented by Azure Data Factory, is designed to streamline data storage, processing, and movement. You also learned about monitoring data transformation in Fabric, which involves tracking the ingestion, processing, analysis, and transformation of data from various streaming sources. Lastly, you learned about the admin monitoring workspace in Microsoft Fabric that provides insights into user activity, content sharing, and capacity performance.

The main takeaways from this module include the importance of regular monitoring, ensuring scalability, and implementing data quality checks in both the speed and batch layers. Monitoring in Fabric Data Factory involves tracking data transformation tasks to ensure efficient pipeline runs and dataflows. Refreshing and monitoring semantic models can also be done using pipelines in the Data Factory. Microsoft Fabric offers a significant feature of alerts and actions, which are supported in various areas including Real-Time hubs, KQL Queryset modifications, Blob Storage events, among others.
