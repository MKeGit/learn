This module covers the broad article of monitoring data ingestion and transformation using Microsoft Fabric. It delves into the Lambda approach, which includes a speed layer and a batch layer, and how these components are used in real-time intelligence and data factory workloads.

Imagine you're a data engineer in a large retail company. Your company recently started using Microsoft Fabric for its data ingestion and transformation needs. However, the team is facing challenges in effectively monitoring the data ingestion process and ensuring smooth data pipeline runs. They need to track key metrics, set up alerts, visualize data through dashboards, and maintain audit logs. Additionally, they need to monitor the transformation of data from various streaming sources and ensure efficient data pipelines. This module guides you on how to overcome these challenges.

The articles covered in this module include:

- Monitoring Data Ingestion in Real-Time Intelligence and Azure Data Factory
- Monitoring and Optimizing Data Transformation in Fabric Real-Time Intelligence and Data Factory
- Managing and Monitoring Semantic Models in Microsoft Fabric
- Understanding Alerts and Actions in Microsoft Fabric
- Working with Delta Tables in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse using Apache Spark

By the end of this module, you're able to effectively monitor data ingestion and transformation in Microsoft Fabric. You also gain the knowledge to set up and manage an admin monitoring workspace, and utilize the alerts and actions feature. You gain hands-on experience in using Apache Spark with delta tables in a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse.
