Retrieve valuable insights from your data by applying a machine learning model.

By tracking a model with MLflow while training it in Microsoft Fabric, you can configure the model's expected inputs and outputs at scoring time.

When you save a model with its necessary model artifacts in Microsoft Fabric, you can easily apply it to new data and save the predictions in a delta table, ready for further processing.
