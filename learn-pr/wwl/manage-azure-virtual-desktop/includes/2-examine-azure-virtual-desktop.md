Azure Virtual Desktop, a cloud-based desktop and app virtualization service on Microsoft Azure, offers access to remote desktops and apps across various devices, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux. It also supports most modern browsers for accessing experiences hosted on Azure Virtual Desktop.
## Optimal User Experience 

Azure Virtual Desktop allows users to connect via any device with internet access using a native client or the Azure Virtual Desktop HTML5 web client. Users experience minimal load times since session host VMs are close to the apps and services connected to the data center or cloud. Containerized user profiles enable fast user sign-ins through FSLogix. Personal (persistent) desktops can be provided for individual ownership, allowing users to modify programs without affecting others.
## Enhanced Security 

Centralized security management for user desktops is achieved with Microsoft Entra ID, enabling multifactor authentication and granular role-based access controls. Running data and apps on remote servers reduces the risk of confidential data on personal devices. User sessions are isolated in single and multi-session environments, and Azure Virtual Desktop uses reverse connect technology for more secure connections.
## Simplified Management 

Azure Virtual Desktop offers familiar management tools for Azure administrators, such as Microsoft Entra ID, role-based access controls, automated VM deployments, VM updates, and disaster recovery. It also utilizes Azure Monitor for monitoring and alerts.
## Performance Management
 
Load balancing options for VM host pools ensure optimal performance. Breadth mode load balancing allocates users sequentially across the host pool, while depth mode fully allocates users on one VM before moving to the next. Tools are available to provision other VMs when demand exceeds a specified threshold automatically.
## Multi-session Windows 10 Deployment 

Azure Virtual Desktop supports Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, the only Windows client-based OS that enables multiple concurrent users on a single VM. It also offers broader application support compared to Windows Server-based OSs.
## Licensing Options
 
Azure Virtual Desktop is available for eligible Microsoft 365 license holders at no extra cost, with only Azure resource usage fees applicable. Existing Windows or Microsoft 365 licenses can be used for Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 7 Enterprise desktops and apps, and eligible Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Client Access License (CAL) customers have access to Windows Server Remote Desktop Services desktops and apps at no extra cost.
## Compute Cost Savings 

Purchasing one-year or three-year Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances can save up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go pricing, with up-front or monthly payment options. Reservations provide a billing discount without affecting the runtime state of resources.
