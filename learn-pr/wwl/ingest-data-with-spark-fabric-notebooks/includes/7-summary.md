 
In this module, you learned how to use Spark and Fabric notebooks to ingest data into a lakehouse.

Fabric notebooks offer automation and a comprehensive solution for ingestion and transformation. Fabric notebooks use a Spark engine to allow a multi-threaded, distributed transaction for speedy processes. Lakehouses support structured, semi-structured, and unstructured files and Delta tables. Optimize Delta table configuration for more performant reads and writes.

Before moving to the transformation and modeling steps, consider where to transform and how users interact with the data.
