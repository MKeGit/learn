Data Activator in Microsoft Fabric takes action based on what's happening in your data. Consider the following three scenarios:  

- You need a notification in your Real-Time Dashboard when certain conditions are met, such as if you have a safety stock level drop below a predefined threshold. In this case you can send alert notifications to email and start a reorder event.
- A sales associate needs to receive alerts when a potential client is visiting their website and offers to start a live chat with them.  
- A network administrator detects potential security breaches through real-time monitoring and initiates immediate protective actions.
- A file arrives in Azure Blob Storage container and Activator starts a new activity in Real-Time Intelligence in event house.
- A tile changes in a Real-Time Dashboard and sends and email or Microsoft Teams message to a user for action.

Data Activator experience covers all those scenarios because it allows Fabric to operate and act from events that are generated and processed from data streams.  

Data Activator is the right tool for scenarios where you want to evaluate conditions against your data, and trigger action from those conditions. Whether you require data ingestion from different experiences like *EventStreams*, need to trigger *Power Automate* flows, or want to visualize data in real-time with *Power BI*, Data Activator facilitates it seamlessly.  

This module aims to provide an overview of Data Activator, its architecture, and how it can be used to monitor and respond to real-time data streams. By the end of this module, you have a firm foundation to start using Data Activator effectively.
