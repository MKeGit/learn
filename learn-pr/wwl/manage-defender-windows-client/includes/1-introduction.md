Windows computers are more susceptible to network threats than other sources, as web-based attacks can target numerous devices and be executed remotely. In contrast, alternative forms of attacks necessitate physical access. Windows Security, the built-in security platform in Windows, offers comprehensive protection against common security threats.

Despite preventative measures, malware can still infiltrate your organization's computers and devices, requiring immediate investigation and remediation. Windows includes components to assist in identifying and eradicating malware from your environment. Additionally, the Windows Defender Firewall delivers integrated functionality to safeguard Windows computers from unauthorized access or undesirable incoming and outgoing network traffic.
