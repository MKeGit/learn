Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence solution provides an end-to-end streaming solution for real-time data analysis across the Fabric service.

Real-Time Intelligence delivers high performance for data of various sizes, ranging from a few gigabytes to several petabytes. It can handle data from different sources and in various formats. Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence workload can be used for solutions like IoT and log analytics in many scenarios including manufacturing, oil and gas, and automotive.

Using the Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence, you can:

- Create an *eventstream* to capture, transform, and ingest real-time data from various streaming sources.
- Store captured real-time data in an *eventhouse*, which includes one or more *KQL databases*.
- Query and analyze data in the eventhouse by using KQL queries, organized in a *KQL queryset*.
- Visualize real-time data in a *real-time dashboard* or by using Power BI.
- Configure alerts that use *Activator* to trigger automated actions.
