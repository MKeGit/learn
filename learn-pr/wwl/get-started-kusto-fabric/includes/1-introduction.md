This module covers the broad topic of Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence, an end-to-end streaming solution optimized for high-speed time-series data analysis. It's designed to handle data of various sizes from different sources and supports automatic partitioning and indexing of any data format.

Imagine you're a data analyst in a large corporation that deals with massive amounts of data daily. You need a solution that can ingest data from any source, run analytical queries directly on raw data, and scale to an unlimited amount of data. You also need to visualize data insights through dashboards and reports, and set alerts for specific thresholds. This is where Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence comes into play, providing a streamlined workflow from data loading to visualization.

The topics covered in this module include:
- Understanding and Utilizing Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence.
- Exploring Core Components and Objects of Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric.
- Understanding and Utilizing Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Hub.
- Using Kusto Query Language (KQL) to Create, Load, and Query Tables.
- Building and Querying a KQL database in Microsoft Fabric.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to understand how Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence works, its core components, and how to use the Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze and extract insights from data. You'll also get hands-on experience through a practical exercise.
