In this module, we walked through a scenario where both data engineers need to ingest, transform, and load data into a Fabric data store such as a lakehouse. We also identified data analyst needs to perform transformations closer to the data source to support Power BI report development.

With Microsoft Fabric, you can create Dataflows Gen2 to perform data integration for your lakehouse, and optionally include the dataflow in a Data Pipeline as well. You learned about Dataflows Gen2 and how to use them as part of your data integration process. Power Query Online offers a visual interface to perform complex data transformations without writing any code.

To learn more about data integration, see the [Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/data-factory/) documentation.
