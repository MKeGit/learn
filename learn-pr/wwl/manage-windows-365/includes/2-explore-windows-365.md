Windows 365 is a cutting-edge cloud-based service that simplifies how you create and manage virtual machines. It automatically generates a new Windows virtual machine called Cloud PCs for your end users. With Windows 365, each Cloud PC is assigned to an individual user, providing them with a dedicated Windows device. By using Windows 365, you can experience the benefits of Microsoft 365, which include increased productivity, enhanced security, and seamless collaboration. With these features, Windows 365 offers a flexible and scalable solution to support your organization's growth and changing needs.

Windows 365 is available in two editions:

 -  **Windows 365 Business:** Windows 365 Business is made specifically for use in smaller companies (up to 300 seats) who want ready-to-use Cloud PCs with simple management options. There are no licensing prerequisites to set up Windows 365 Business. There are no dependencies on Azure or Active Directory. Purchases are made through the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Windows 365 product site. For more information, see [Getting started with Windows 365 Business and Cloud PCs](/windows-365/business/get-started-windows-365-business).
 -  **Windows 365 Enterprise:** Windows 365 Enterprise is designed for larger organizations seeking unlimited seats to create Cloud PCs. It offers the flexibility to build custom Cloud PCs using your own device images, provides additional management options, and seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Intune. Windows 365 Enterprise utilizes Microsoft Entra ID and AD DS domains to enhance its functionality. For more information, see [What is Windows 365 Enterprise?](/windows-365/enterprise/overview).
