*Eventstreams* enable you to capture and process real-time events without needing to write any code. You can set up event sources, destinations, and transformations in the event stream; enabling you to collect, filter, aggregate, group, and combine data from real-time sources before loading it into a destination.

Some of the main benefits of Microsoft Fabric Eventstreams are:

- You can capture, transform, and route real-time events to various destinations with a no-code experience. You can use the drag and drop feature to make your event data processing logic without writing any code.
- There are multiple source connectors to get event data from different sources, such as Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hub, Azure storage, Apache Kafka, and others.
- You can send data to a wide range of destinations for further analysis or processing. You can attach multiple destinations in an eventstream to ingest data from a single source into multiple stores.
- Eventstreams uses a scalable infrastructure that manages resources automatically. The scalable infrastructure helps you capture your real-time events easily, making streaming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations possible.

In this module, you'll learn how to create eventstreams and use them to ingest and transform a real-time stream of data, and route it to destinations for further processing and analysis.
