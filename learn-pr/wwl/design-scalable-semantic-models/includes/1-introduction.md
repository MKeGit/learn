Scalable semantic models enable organizations to analyze and report on large, complex data sources with ease. Microsoft Fabric makes it possible to work with high volume and large-scale data with the right groundwork in place. 

Imagine you're on the analytics team at a major e-commerce company, preparing for the biggest annual sales event. In the past, tracking and analyzing customer behavior, purchase patterns, and product performance was manual and time-consuming. This year, you're streamlining the process by designing a semantic model in Microsoft Fabric. The goals are to analyze large volumes of sales data and provide insights on product performance all while ensuring the system scales seamlessly.

This module introduces considerations for building enterprise-scale, data-driven solutions, including data modeling best practices and Microsoft Fabric features for working with large data. *Enterprise-scale* or *large-scale* data refers to tables with a large number of records or rows.

By the end, you'll be able to choose a model framework and apply best practices to create a semantic model optimized for large-scale data analytics.
