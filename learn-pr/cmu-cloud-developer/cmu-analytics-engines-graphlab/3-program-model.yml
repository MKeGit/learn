      For the following graph, under the full consistency model, what's the maximum number of vertices that can read or write data in parallel at any given time? <br><br>
      <img alt="Diagram of graph showing vertex V1 connected to V2, V3, and V6; then vertex V2 connected to V4 and V3 connected to V4 and V5." src="./media/quiz-units-2-and-4-vertices-graph.png" />
    choices:
    - content: "5"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Under the full consistency model, a vertex that's reading or writing data has a lock on all incident edges and adjacent vertices. In this graph, V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> can read and write data in parallel as their scopes will not overlap. The maximum number of vertices that can read or write data in parallel is 2."
    - content: "4"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Under the full consistency model, a vertex that's reading or writing data has a lock on all incident edges and adjacent vertices. In this graph, V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> can read and write data in parallel as their scopes will not overlap. The maximum number of vertices that can read or write data in parallel is 2."
    - content: "2"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Under the full consistency model, any vertex that's reading or writing data has an exclusive lock on all incident edges and adjacent vertices. In this graph, V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> can read and write data in parallel as their scopes will not overlap."
    - content: "1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Under the full consistency model, a vertex that's reading or writing data has a lock on all incident edges and adjacent vertices. In this graph, V<sub>5</sub> and V<sub>6</sub> can read and write data in parallel as their scopes will not overlap. The maximum number of vertices that can read or write data in parallel is 2."
