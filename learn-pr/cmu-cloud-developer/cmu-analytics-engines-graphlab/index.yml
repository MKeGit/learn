abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
    - Describe the unique features in GraphLab and the application types that it targets
    - Recall the features of a graph-parallel distributed programming framework
    - Recall the three main parts in the GraphLab engine
    - Describe the steps that are involved in the GraphLab execution engine
    - Discuss the architectural model of GraphLab
    - Recall the scheduling strategy of GraphLab
    - Describe the programming model of GraphLab
    - List and explain the consistency levels in GraphLab
    - Describe the in-memory data placement strategy in GraphLab and its performance implications for certain types of graphs
    - Discuss the computational model of GraphLab
    - Discuss the fault-tolerance mechanisms in GraphLab
    - Identify the steps that are involved in the execution of a GraphLab program
    - Compare and contrast MapReduce, Spark, and GraphLab in terms of their programming, computation, parallelism, architectural, and scheduling models
    - Identify a suitable analytics engine given an application's characteristics
  
  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
