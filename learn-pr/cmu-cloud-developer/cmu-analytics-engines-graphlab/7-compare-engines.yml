  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following frameworks is best suited to compute all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) on a weighted, fully connected graph?"
    choices:
    - content: "MapReduce"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. APSP is a graph computation. A graph-parallel framework might be best suited for this application."
    - content: "Spark"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. APSP is a graph computation. A graph-parallel framework might be best suited for this application."
    - content: "GraphLab"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! APSP on a fully connected graph should converge symmetrically. A graph-parallel framework like GraphLab might be best suited for this application."
