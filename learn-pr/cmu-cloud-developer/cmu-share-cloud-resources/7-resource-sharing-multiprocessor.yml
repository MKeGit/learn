  questions:

# Did I Get This block question 1 has intro statement and no visible graphic   
#  - content: "Match the benefits with sharing a multiprocessor system either in space or in time."

# Did I Get This block question 2
  - content: "What is the upper limit on the number of partitions that can be supported in a multiprocessor system with <i>N</i> processors shared in <b>space</b>?"
    choices:
    - content: "<i>N</i>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "<i>N</i>-1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Remember that in space sharing, access to a partition is exclusive. The right answer is <i>N</i>, not <i>N</i>-1."
    - content: "In principle, it's infinity. But in practice, <i>c</i> &#215; <i>N</i>, where <i>c</i> is a constant factor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is an upper limit for **time**, not space. Remember that in space sharing, access to a partition is exclusive."

# Did I Get This block question 3
  - content: "What is the upper limit on the number of partitions that can be supported in a multiprocessor system with <i>N</i> processors shared in <b>time</b>?"
    choices:
    - content: "<i>N</i>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is an upper limit on the number of partitions for **space**, not time. When sharing a multiple processor in time, is there any limitation on how many concurrent partitions we can have?"
    - content: "<i>N</i>-1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When sharing a multiple processor in time, is there any limitation on how many concurrent partitions we can have? The right answer is based on <i>N</i>, not <i>N</i>-1."
    - content: "In principle, it's infinity. But in practice, <i>c</i> &#215; <i>N</i>, where <i>c</i> is a constant factor."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
