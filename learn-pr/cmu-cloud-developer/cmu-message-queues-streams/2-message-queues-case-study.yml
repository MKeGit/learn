  questions:
  - content: "How would you organize messages in a Kafka cluster, if you needed them to be processed in order by consumers?"

    - content: "Messages can be published in round-robin order over multiple Kafka topics. Kafka guarantees the order of messages across topics using a sequence number."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Where does Kafka maintain an append-only immutable log? Review this page if you're not sure."
    - content: "Messages must be published within a Kafka topic, as all messages within a Kafka topic are guaranteed to be in order."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Where does Kafka maintain an append-only immutable log? Review this page if you're not sure."
    - content: "Messages must be published within a partition in a Kafka topic, as all messages within a partition are guaranteed to be ordered."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Kafka guarantees that messages within a partition are ordered by arrival. Messages across partitions or topics are not guaranteed to be ordered."
