# question not in original course
  - content: "Microsoft offers customers a 10% service credit if the monthly uptime for an Azure App Service instance falls below 99.95%. Assuming a month is 31 days, how many minutes must an App Service instance be down in one month to trigger a credit?"

# question not in original course - remove from visibility
#  - content: "Suppose you build a solution that consists of two interconnected cloud services, each of which comes with an SLA that guarantees the service will be up at least 99.50% of the time. What is the expected minimum uptime for the solution as a whole?"
#    choices:
#    - content: "99.75%"
#      isCorrect: false
#      explanation: "Incorrect. Given that the solution is down if either service is unavailable, the combined uptime must be less than the individual uptimes."
#    - content: "99.50%"
#      isCorrect: false
#      explanation: "Incorrect. Given that the solution is down if either service is unavailable, the combined uptime must be less than the individual uptimes."
#    - content: "99.00%"
#      isCorrect: true
#      explanation: "Correct! The uptime for the solution is the product of the uptimes for the individual services that compose it."
#    - content: "95.20%"
#      isCorrect: false
#      explanation: "Incorrect. Given that the solution is down if either service is unavailable, the combined uptime must be less than the individual uptimes."
