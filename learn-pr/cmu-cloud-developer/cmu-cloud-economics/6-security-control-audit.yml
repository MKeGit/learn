# Did I get this block question 1
# Order of choices changed from what's shown in original course
  - content: "On VM, if you install Wireshark, you should be able to sniff packets from:"
    choices:
    - content: "Only my VM."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Due to the isolation provided by VM's cloud provider, Wireshark will work only in your VM."
    - content: "Nothing. Wireshark will not work on the VM."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Consider the types of attacks made possible when a cloud provider offers shared infrastructure to multiple tenants. What level of isolation is provided in a VM?"
    - content: "All VMs in the same physical machine."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Consider the types of attacks made possible when a cloud provider offers shared infrastructure to multiple tenants. What level of isolation is provided in a VM?"
    - content: "All VMs in the same rack."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Consider the types of attacks made possible when a cloud provider offers shared infrastructure to multiple tenants. What level of isolation is provided in a VM?"

# Did I get this block question 2
  - content: "The process of mapping instances from the virtual cloud to the physical infrastructure is called cloud cartography. Assuming that you're an IaaS provider, which of the following will protect an attacker from mapping your service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Statically allocating private IPs (used for communication within the cloud network)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. What you really want to do is make sure that the IP addresses aren't predictable. Which of these options provides the most unpredictable allocation of resources?"
    - content: "Allowing VMs to access properties of the underlying hardware"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. What you really want to do is make sure that the IP addresses aren't predictable. Which of these options provides the most unpredictable allocation of resources?"
    - content: "Statically allocating public IPs (as viewed over the public internet)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. What you really want to do is make sure that the IP addresses aren't predictable. Which of these options provides the most unpredictable allocation of resources?"
    - content: "Dynamically allocating both public and private IPs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As long as the IP addresses are allocated in an unpredictable fashion, your service is difficult to map."

# Did I get this block question 3
# Answer for choice #2 includes additional explanation from what is in original course
  - content: "You host an email server on the cloud only to find that the emails that your service sends are categorized as spam by anti-spammers like Spamhaus. However, the content of your mails is not spam-like. What could be a possible reason for this filtering?"
    choices:
    - content: "This is just an inherent problem of public clouds, where you have to share resources with untrusted entities, which could impact you in unpredictable ways. Cloud providers should add features like outbound spam monitoring to protect their own reputation. Services like Spamhaus should continue unchanged."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. As many services move to the clouds, anti-spam agents like Spamhaus cannot continue to broadly block IP addresses. Consider the techniques used by Spamhaus to block spam sources. Do they translate well to public cloud infrastructure?"
    - content: "You should never host an email server on the public cloud because the Massive Surveillance Bureau will be tracking it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Public clouds can be an extremely secure place to store data if used properly, and the Massive Surveillance Bureau is something we made up. Consider the techniques used by Spamhaus to block spam sources. Do they translate well to public cloud infrastructure?"
    - content: "Both Spamhaus and cloud providers need to adapt to this new type of problem."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This is an evolving problem due to the complex and ever-changing patterns of spam."
    - content: "This problem is due to IP reputation systems only. These systems broadly categorize large subnets of IP addresses as spammers, even if only a few of them actually contribute to spam traffic. Instead, reputation-based blocking should be done for each IP address. The cloud provider cannot take any action to protect itself."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Reputation-based blocking can't be done per IP address because this technique is not scalable. IP addresses can be easily changed. Consider the techniques used by Spamhaus to block spam sources. Do they translate well to public cloud infrastructure?"

# Did I get this block question 4
  - content: "Some service providers offer dedicated VM instances as an added security measure. Such instances are guaranteed to run on dedicated hardware that will not be shared with other users of the cloud service. Which of the following threats will you be protected against on a dedicated VM?"
    choices:
    - content: "Datacenter failure leading to your VM shutting down."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Consider the types of attacks that are made possible when a cloud provider offers shared infrastructure to multiple tenants. What security risks are posed by shared infrastructure in clouds?"
    - content: "A vulnerability in your website that allows hackers to deface it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Consider the types of attacks that are made possible when a cloud provider offers shared infrastructure to multiple tenants. What security risks are posed by shared infrastructure in clouds?"
    - content: "Malicious code from a competitor hosted on a neighboring VM."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. With dedicated infrastructure, we can eliminate the threat of a competitor running malicious code from a neighboring VM."
    - content: "A vulnerability on the physical server that the cloud provider did not patch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Consider the types of attacks that are made possible when a cloud provider offers shared infrastructure to multiple tenants. What security risks are posed by shared infrastructure in clouds?"

# Did I get this block question 5
  - content: "A cloud firewall resides within the hypervisor layer, between the physical network interface and the instance's virtual interface. All packets must pass through this layer; thus an instance's neighbors have no more access to that instance than any other host on the internet and can be treated as if they are on separate physical hosts. These can be configured as security groups. What is one disadvantage of this method?"
    choices:
    - content: "It doesn't protect you from bad traffic sent from other instances, since they're inside the firewall."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Think about the disadvantages of having an externally managed firewall over which you have limited control."
    - content: "Because the firewall isn't hosted on the instance, it's more vulnerable if your instance gets breached, because the attacker can easily change the security group settings from within the instance."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Think about the disadvantages of having an externally managed firewall over which you have limited control."
    - content: "It doesn't protect you from bad traffic sent from other instances on the same hardware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Think about the disadvantages of having an externally managed firewall over which you have limited control."
    - content: "The security groups don't let you log traffic that's being blocked, so you have reduced visibility about security events."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!" 

# Did I get this block question 6
  - content: "Homomorphic encryption is a special form of encryption where computation can be carded out on encrypted data. For instance, if Bing used homomorphic encryption, it would receive an encrypted version of your search term, find the matches without looking at it, and return an encrypted version of the results. Your data would never be exposed. Recent research from Craig Gentry at Stanford demonstrated a practical way to create an encryption scheme that allows addition and multiplication. Why is this not widely used?"
    choices:
    - content: "The government won't allow encryption that it can't decrypt through a legal channel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Think about the efficiency of computing in an encrypted space."
    - content: "The scheme is currently computationally very expensive, and takes too long."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Gentry's scheme supports both addition and multiplication operations on ciphertexts, from which it's impossible to construct circuits for performing arbitrary computation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Think about the efficiency of computing in an encrypted space."

# Did I get this block question 7
  - content: "If you're an educator building a service that runs and grades student code to add two numbers, which of the following should you **not** do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run the script with the least privileges required."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. This operation is something that the service should do when it runs unknown code. What would malicious code need in order to inflict damage to such a service?"
    - content: "Block network access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. This operation is something that the service should do when it runs unknown code. What would malicious code need in order to inflict damage to such a service?"
    - content: "Restrict the amount of memory that the code can access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. This operation is something that the service should do when it runs unknown code. What would malicious code need in order to inflict damage to such a service?"
    - content: "Add a timeout to kill the code after a certain duration."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. This operation is something that the service should do when it runs unknown code. What would malicious code need in order to inflict damage to such a service?"                        
    - content: "Block the script from accessing any files outside the given folder."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. This operation is something that the service should do when it runs unknown code. What would malicious code need in order to inflict damage to such a service?"      
    - content: "Run the script as the root user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Log any code that violates the policies, because it might corrupt the logs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. This operation is something that the service should do when it runs unknown code. What would malicious code need in order to inflict damage to such a service?"
