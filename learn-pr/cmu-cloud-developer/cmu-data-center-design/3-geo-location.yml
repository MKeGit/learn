  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Company X has a datacenter in Houston, Texas, and pays a power bill of $1,700,000 in power costs annually. The company is planning to relocate to an identical facility in Vancouver, Canada. The move allows the company to utilize air-side economization from the beginning of October through the end of March. The company's chiller consumes 25% of the total power drawn by the datacenter and can be turned off during air-side economization. Assuming all other costs are identical, how much money can company X save annually when it relocates to Vancouver?"
    choices:
    - content: "$425,000"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The company has the potential to save money on 25% of the expenses incurred during 6 months of the year. The key element to factor in is the amount of time in a year that the datacenter chiller can be turned off. The savings amount to ($1,710,000 / 2) x 0.25 = $212,500."
