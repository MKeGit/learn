  questions:

  - content: "What are the considerations for an ideal scheduler for distributed programs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Response time"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Throughput"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Resource utilization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Resource heterogeneity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Locality"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Fairness"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Load balancing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Reducing communication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Facilitating scalability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "Meeting SLOs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only consideration for an ideal scheduler? What about the other aspects of the program?"
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "Why is meeting SLOs a challenge in cloud computing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Heterogeneity in cloud resources"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Heterogeneity in cloud resources poses a challenge in cloud computing, but is this the only reason?"
    - content: "Task elasticity is an issue"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Task elasticity poses a challenge in cloud computing, but is this the only reason?"
    - content: "SLOs are hard to define"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. SLOs are not difficult to define in terms of service availability and expected throughput, among others."
    - content: "Heterogeneity in cloud resources and task elasticity is an issue"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! These are both issues that pose challenges in meeting SLOs in cloud computing."
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. SLOs are not difficult to define in terms of service availability and expected throughput, among others."
