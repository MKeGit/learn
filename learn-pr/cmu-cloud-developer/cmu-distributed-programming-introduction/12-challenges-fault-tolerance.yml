      Consider the actions performed by the processes P and Q in the following figure:
      
      * Arrows denote the messages that are passed between the processes.
      * P<sub>1</sub> through P<sub>5</sub> denote the checkpoints of P.
      * Q<sub>1</sub> through Q<sub>3</sub> denote the checkpoints of Q.
      
      :::image type="content" source="./media/quiz-fault-tolerance.png" alt-text="Sequence diagram between process P and Q showing several back-and-forth interactions: from Q to P before checkpoint p1 and back to Q, then from P to Q before checkpoint q1 and back to P before checkpoint p2, then from Q to P and back to Q before checkpoint p3 and then checkpoint q2, then from Q to P before checkpoint p4 and back to Q before checkpoint q3, then four more from P to Q before checkpoint p5, then a failure occurs on Q.":::
      <br/>
      What checkpoints at P and Q form a recovery line that processes P and Q can roll back to?
    choices:
    - content: "P<sub>3</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! There are no messages sent between P and Q in between checkpoints P<sub>3</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>. The checkpoint leads to a consistent state from which the system can recover."
    - content: "P<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>1</sub>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q, so a recovery line can't be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
    - content: "P<sub>5</sub> and Q<sub>3</sub>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q, so a recovery line can't be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
    - content: "P<sub>2</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A number of messages are sent between P and Q, so a recovery line can't be formed. The recovery line needs to be consistent with respect to the states of the processes. Find one
                where no messages are passed in the time between the recovery points."
