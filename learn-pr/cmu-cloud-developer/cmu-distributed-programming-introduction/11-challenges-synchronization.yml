      Assume the following function:

      ```
      transaction (Account source, Account destination, double amount)
      {
        Acquire lock on source;
        Acquire lock on destination;
        withdraw(from, amount);
        deposit(to, amount);
        Release lock on destination;
        Release lock on source;
      }
      ```
      
      Assume that initially accounts A and B both have 100 dollars and the following operations are executed simultaneously, such that both operations acquire a lock on the source account (as indicated in line number 3 in the transaction function) at the same time:
      
      ```
      1 Transaction(A,B,50); and Transaction(B,A,10);
      ```
      
      What will be the result?
    choices:
    - content: "A will have 140 dollars and B will have 60 dollars."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The presence of locks guarantees that the result will never be inconsistent. Pay close attention to the order in which the locks on the accounts are acquired."
    - content: "A will have 60 dollars and B will have 90 dollars."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The presence of locks guarantees that the result will never be inconsistent. Pay close attention to the order in which the locks on the accounts are acquired."
    - content: "A will have 110 dollars and B will have 90 dollars."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The presence of locks guarantees that the result will never be inconsistent. Pay close attention to the order in which the locks on the accounts are acquired."
    - content: "The transactions will never finish due to a deadlock."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The simultaneous acquisition of locks on both A and B by two separate transactions will lead to a deadlock because transaction 1 will fail to acquire the second lock on account B, and transaction 2 will fail to acquire the second lock on account A. At least one of them has to release the lock and start over for the transactions to proceed."
