  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Assume a program that runs for 15 hours on a single processor. One-third of the program consists of data access, which is serial, and the remaining two-thirds consists of computation, which can be parallelized ad infinitum. What is the least amount of time in which the program can execute?"
    choices:
    - content: "3 hours"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Applying Amdahl's Law, the maximum speedup can be calculated as (1 / (1/3)) = 3. Hence, this program cannot execute in less than 5 hours, even with an infinite number of parallel processors."
    - content: "5 hours"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Applying Amdahl's Law, this program cannot execute in less than 5 hours, even with an infinite number of parallel processors."
    - content: "10 hours"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Applying Amdahl's Law, the maximum speedup can be calculated as (1 / (1/3)) = 3. Hence, this program cannot execute in less than 5 hours, even with an infinite number of parallel processors."
