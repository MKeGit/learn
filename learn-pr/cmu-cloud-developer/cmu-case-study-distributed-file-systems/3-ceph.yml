  questions:

  - content: "At its core, Ceph is a:"
    choices:
    - content: "Distributed file system"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Ceph can be used as a distributed file system through CephFS, its core element is not a distributed file system. What kind of system is RADOS?"
    - content: "Block storage system"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While a layer called RBD can be used to export block storage devices from Ceph, it is not a block storage system at its core. What kind of system is RADOS?"      
    - content: "Relational database system"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. What kind of system is RADOS?"
    - content: "Distributed key-value (object) store"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The core component of Ceph is RADOS, which is essentially a distributed key-value store."
    - content: "Local file system"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. What kind of system is RADOS?"

  - content: "When writing an application that uses Ceph storage cluster, developers are limited to either RADOSGW, RBD or the CephFS APIs."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Are these the only APIs available to interact with a Ceph storage cluster? There is a lower level API that can be used to interact with Ceph. "
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! The **librados** library allows developers to interact with a Ceph storage cluster at the lowest (object) level."
