  questions:

# Did I Get This block 1 question has only intro statement and no visible graphic      
# content: "Order the operations of a file write in HDFS in the table."

# Did I Get This block 2 question 1
  - content: "What are the advantages of HDFS over local file systems?"
    choices:
    - content: "Common namespace for the cluster"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. A common namespace is an advantage of HDFS, but it is not the only advantage HDFS has over local file systems."
    - content: "Streaming file access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Streaming file access is an advantage of HDFS, but it is not the only advantage HDFS has over local file systems."
    - content: "Support for large files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Support for large files is an advantage of HDFS, but it is not the only advantage HDFS has over local file systems."
    - content: "Support for a large number of small files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. HDFS typically uses large block sizes when compared to local file systems, which can cause performance issues for a large number of small files."
    - content: "High data availability through replication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. High data availability through replication is an advantage of HDFS, but it is not the only advantage HDFS has over local file systems."
    - content: "No single point of failure (SPOF)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The NameNode in HDFS is currently a SPOF."
    - content: "Common namespace for the cluster, support for large files, support for a large number of small files, high data availability through replication, and no single point of failure (SPOF)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. HDFS does not natively support a large number of small files, and the NameNode in HDFS is currently an SPOF."
    - content: "Common namespace for the cluster, streaming file access, support for large files, and high data availability through replication"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "All of the above"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. HDFS does not natively support a large number of small files, and the NameNode in HDFS is currently an SPOF."      

# Did I Get This block 2 question 2 - $ symbols open and close LaTeX math formatting
  - content: "When does HDFS commit a write to disk?"
    choices:
    - content: "When the first replica has finished writing to a disk"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although HDFS streams the `N - 1` replicas of a block directly from the server writing the first replica, the write is not committed at this point. Remember that HDFS offers strongly consistent file systems."
    - content: "When a majority of the replicas have finished writing `( > N/2 )`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. HDFS requires all replicas to be written to disk for a write to be committed. Remember that HDFS offers strongly consistent file systems."
    - content: "When the last replica has finished writing to a disk"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

# Did I Get This block 2 question 3
  - content: "What kind of consistency model does HDFS offer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Strong consistency"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! HDFS's immutable semantics, along with its replica commit policy, give it strong consistency guarantees."
    - content: "Weak consistency"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. HDFS has immutable semantics, and a write is committed only after all replicas are written to a disk. Think about any possible restrictions in HDFS, and why they are in place. Will any client at any time see an inconsistent view of the file system?"
