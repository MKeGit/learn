  questions:

# Did I Get This block 1 question 1
  - content: "When the guest and host ISAs are different, the only CPU virtualization mechanism that can be used is:"
    choices:
    - content: "Direct native execution"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is not possible because ISAs are different. There are various ways to do it. What is the technique called?"
    - content: "Interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a valid technique but not the only one. There are various ways to do it. What is the technique called?"
    - content: "Binary translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is a valid technique but not the only one. There are various ways to do it. What is the technique called?"
    - content: "Emulation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Emulation encompasses interpretation and binary translation. More precisely, it can be carried out using either interpretation or binary translation."

# Did I Get This block 1 question 2
  - content: "The process of decoding an instruction only once, saving the extracted information in an intermediate form, and reusing the instruction each time it is encountered is called:"
    choices:
    - content: "Threaded interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Threaded interpretation could be direct or indirect. Understand that the encoding is done at the start and then reused."
    - content: "Indirect-threaded interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Indirect-threaded interpretation does not employ any intermediate form. Understand that the encoding is done at the start and then reused."
    - content: "Direct-threaded interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Direct-threaded interpretation uses such a process, but has more processes or functionalities. Understand that the encoding is done at the start and then reused."
    - content: "Predecoding"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

# Did I Get This block 1 question 3
  - content: "A major limitation of indirect-threaded interpretation is the requirement of looking up a table on each dispatch. To get rid of such a level of indirection, it was suggested in 1973 to replace the instruction opcodes contained in the intermediate form with the actual addresses of the interpreter routines. What is this method called?"
    choices:
    - content: "Direct-threaded interpretation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Predecoding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The basic predecoding process does not include the actual addresses of the interpreter routines in the intermediate code. Remember that it's called *indirect threaded* because interpreting each instruction needs a lookup table instead of directly being able to run an interpretation routine."
    - content: "Indirect-threaded interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Indirect-threaded interpretation does not employ any intermediate form. Remember that it's called *indirect threaded* because interpreting each instruction needs a lookup table instead of directly being able to run an interpretation routine."
    - content: "Decode-and-dispatch interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decode-and-dispatch interpretation does not employ any intermediate form. Remember that it's called *indirect threaded* because interpreting each instruction needs a lookup table instead of directly being able to run an interpretation routine."

# Did I Get This block 1 question 4
  - content: "With predecoding, all the source instructions of the same types are extracted with the same interpretation routine. Performance can be significantly enhanced by mapping each individual source binary instruction to its own customized target code. This process of converting the source binary program into a target binary program is called:"
    choices:
    - content: "Decode-and-dispatch interpreter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Decode and dispatch is an interpretation scheme. "
    - content: "Direct-threaded interpreter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Direct threaded is an interpretation scheme."      
    - content: "Binary translation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Predecoding"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The predecoding process is different because it is used to generate intermediate code that can be utilized by direct-threaded interpreters."
    - content: "Indirect-threaded interpreter"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Indirect threaded is an interpretation scheme."

      Consider the following snippet of an interpreter code that steps through the source program, decodes each instruction (that is, the extract() function), and calls a corresponding routine depending on the observed opcode. (All routines are omitted, except the first one, for the brevity of the presentation.)
      
      ```
      While (!halt && !interrupt)
      {
          inst = code[PC];
          opcode = extract(inst, 31, 6);

          switch(opcode)
              {
                  case LoadWordAndZero: LoadWordAndZeroRoutine(inst);
                  case ALU: ALUrouting(inst);
                  case Branch: BranchRoutine(inst);
                  ...
              }
      }
      
      LoadWordAndZeroRoutine(inst)
      {
          RT = extract(inst, 25, 5);
          RA = extract(inst, 20, 5);
          Displacement = extract(inst, 15, 16);
          
          if (RA == 0)
              Source = 0;
          else
              Source = reys[RA];

          address = source + displacement;
          reys[RT] = (data[address] << 32) >> 32;
          PC = PC + 4;
      }
      ```
      
      Which of the following statements best describes the above interpreter?
    choices:
    - content: "This interpreter is a threaded one because it is structured around a central loop, a decoder, and a dispatcher."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A threaded interpreter is an interpreter that appends portions of the dispatch code at the end of each interpreter routine. Identify the execution pattern and data structures that are used in the code snippet, and compare them with the techniques covered on this page."
    - content: "This interpreter is a direct-and-dispatch one because it is structured around a central loop, a decoder, and a dispatcher."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only correct answer? Identify the execution pattern and data structures that are used in the code snippet, and compare them with the techniques covered on this page."
    - content: "In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top of the loop, this interpreter exhibits one branch."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There's at least another branch for the switch statement. Identify the execution pattern and data structures that are used in the code snippet, and compare them with the techniques covered on this page."
    - content: "In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top of the loop, this interpreter exhibits three branches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. In addition to a branch for the switch statement, there are other branches, such as a branch to terminate the loop, a branch to the interpreter routine, and a branch to return from the interpreter routine. Identify the execution pattern and data structures that are used in the code snippet, and compare them with the techniques covered on this page."
    - content: "In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top cite loop, this interpreter exhibits four branches."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not quite right. Is this the only correct answer? Identify the execution pattern and data structures that are used in the code snippet, and compare them with the techniques covered on this page."
    - content: "This interpreter is a direct-and-dispatch one because it is structured around a central loop, a decoder, and a dispatcher. In addition to the test for a halt or an interrupt at the top of the loop, this interpreter exhibits four branches."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
