  questions:

  - content: "Two-level page mapping, as employed by system memory virtualization, entails:"
    choices:
    - content: "Physical-to-real address translation"    
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Processes in guest OSs issue virtual addresses. Where is the two-level page mapping technique used, and what address spaces are involved?"
    - content: "Virtual-to-real address translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is only a single level of mapping. In addition to this correct mapping, two-level page mapping still requires another level of mapping. Where is the two-level page mapping technique used, and what address spaces are involved?"
    - content: "Real-to-physical address translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Page tables in guest OSs perform virtual-to-real address translations. Where is the two-level page mapping technique used, and what address spaces are involved?"
    - content: "Virtual-to-real and then real-to-physical address translations"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Page tables in guest OSs perform virtual-to-real address translations, and page tables in the hypervisor (called real page tables) perform real-to-physical address translations. Two-level page mapping assumes a native virtualized system."      
    - content: "Real-to-virtual address translation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Processes in guest OSs issue virtual addresses. Where is the two-level page mapping technique used, and what address spaces are involved?"
