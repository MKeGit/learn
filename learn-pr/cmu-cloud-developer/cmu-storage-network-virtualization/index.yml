title: Storage and network virtualization
summary: Learn about how storage and network resources can be virtualized to support software defined datacenters.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Recall the design considerations in datacenter networks and describe the need for virtualization to support multiple tenants
  - Compare and contrast traditional datacenter networks and software-defined networking (SDN) for the purposes of multi-tenant networks
  - List the various types of storage systems used in datacenters
  - Compare and contrast traditional datacenter storage and software-defined storage (SDS) and list some of the benefits of SDS
  
  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
