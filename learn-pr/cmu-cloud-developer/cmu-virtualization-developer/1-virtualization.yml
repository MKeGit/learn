    choices:
    - content: "Yes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. One of the benefits of virtualization is that the guest OSs running on VMs do not have to be identical. Think about all the ways that two VMs running on a hypervisor are related to each other."
    - content: "No"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"

  - content: "True or false? When a VM is rebooted, the host also has to be rebooted."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Is a VM running on a host any different to a process running on the same host? A VM can be rebooted as a regular host; however, when a VM is rebooted, the host system continues to run normally."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
