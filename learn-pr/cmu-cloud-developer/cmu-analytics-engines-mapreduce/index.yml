title: 'Distributed computing on the cloud: MapReduce'
summary: MapReduce was a breakthrough in big data processing that has become mainstream and been improved upon significantly. Learn about how MapReduce works.
abstract: | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Identify the underlying distributed programming model of MapReduce
  - Explain how MapReduce can exploit data parallelism
  - Identify the input and output of map and reduce tasks
  - Define task elasticity, and indicate its importance for effective job scheduling
  - Explain the map and reduce task-scheduling strategies in Hadoop MapReduce
  - List the elements of the YARN architecture, and identify the role of each element
  - Summarize the lifecycle of a MapReduce job in YARN
  - Compare and contrast the architectures and the resource allocators of YARN and the previous Hadoop MapReduce
  - Indicate how job and task scheduling differ in YARN as opposed to the previous Hadoop MapReduce
  
  In partnership with Dr. Majd Sakr and Carnegie Mellon University.
