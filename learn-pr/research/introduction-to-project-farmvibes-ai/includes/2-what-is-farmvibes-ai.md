Project FarmVibes.AI (for brevity, we'll refer to it as FarmVibes.AI) is a multi-modal geospatial machine learning (ML) tooling tailored for the agricultural and sustainability sector. The platform empowers data scientists and researchers to develop advanced machine learning models by fusing multiple geospatial and spatiotemporal datasets. This enhances their ability to interpret and analyze various data types for robust agricultural and geospatial applications.

FarmVibes.AI:

- connects various data sources, acting as a foundation for building data connectors that integrate information from sensors, satellites, and other sources.
- aids in the preprocessing of data, preparing it for use in geospatial-temporal models. This includes cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data to be suitable for deeper analysis and build AI models.
- provides examples for training AI models, allowing users to tune these models for specific agricultural scenarios such as nutrition or sustainability, showing its compatibility with advanced machine learning operations.
- supports the inference stage, where the trained geospatial models are deployed into an end-to-end workflow. This encompasses helper workflows for data ingestion, processing, and the practical application of FarmVibes.AI and machine learning.
