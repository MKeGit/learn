FarmVibes.AI comprises four components:

**Data Types**: It can process various kinds of data. It includes satellite imagery, soil sensor data, weather information, and other types of agricultural or geospatial data that are critical for analysis in the agri/geospatial sectors.

**Workflows:** It is the set of predefined processes or procedures within FarmVibes.AI. A workflow list includes various automated sequences for data processing, analysis, and reporting that users can select and apply to their datasets to derive insights relevant to their agricultural research or projects.

**Notebooks**: It has a set of example jupyter notebooks for a user, such as data scientist and researcher to get familiar and running various workflows

**FarmVibes.AI Client**: It is the interface through which users, such as data scientists, researchers, and ISVs interact with the FarmVibes.AI workflow. It provides tools for accessing and managing data, running analyses, setting up workflows, visualizing results and integrating in ISV solutions.

In our scenario, you are an ISV who has teamed up with a farmer to improve their farm operations.

You would use FarmVibes.AI to use farm boundary and satellite imagery to determine the soil's nutrient profile. You begin by utilising the **Data Types** component to process diverse data such as satellite imagery and soil sensor data. This would involve collecting soil sample data from strategically chosen locations to create a detailed nutrient map without unnecessary sampling.

Once the data is collected,  you engage FarmVibes.AI's **Workflows** facilitated through specific Workflows designed for data processing and analysis. These predefined processes automate the analysis of your collected data, turning raw data into a detailed nutrient map. This map informs predictive models that could help plan where and when to apply fertilizer, training a micro-climate forecasting model for the location, and one can generate near term forecast. This ensures that fertilizer is used efficiently, improving soil health, and preparing the farm for the upcoming season.

All of these tasks are managed through the **FarmVibes.AI Client**. It allows you to access and manage collected data, run analyses, and visualize results. As the crops grow, FarmVibes.AI continues to provide value by using AI to analyze crop health data from satellite images and other sensors, enabling the farmer to make informed decisions about crop maintenance and farming operations. An ISV could setup regular runs of the FarmVibes.AI workflow and leverage already processed and cached data in the analysis

To better understand and optimize these processes, you utilize **Notebooks**, which are example Jupyter notebooks provided by FarmVibes.AI. They serve as an educational and experimental platform that has guided examples and code that help you manipulate and analyze the data, refine workflows, and even customize some of the AI models according to specific agricultural needs.
