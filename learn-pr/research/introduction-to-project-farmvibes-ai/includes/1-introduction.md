As an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) specializing in AI models for agricultural technology, your objective is to incorporate advanced data analysis tools to help farmers make smart decisions for example soil nutrients and fertilizer use.

A key task for farmers before the season starts is identifying the best locations on their farm for placing sensors or taking soil samples. This is crucial for accurately assessing soil nutrient levels. The right technology is needed to determine these optimal spots, aiming for a comprehensive view of soil health with minimal resource usage.

After gathering nutrient data, the focus shifts to two main aspects of farm management: deciding when and where to apply fertilizer based on weather forecasts and soil conditions, and continuously monitoring crop health and pest activity. These tasks require a data-driven approach, using geospatial datasets, advanced forecasting and arial imagery (e.g satellite imagery) to manage crops effectively and sustainably.

The solution can be deployed using a cloud infrastructure service, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), to ensure scalability and security. AI models and analysis tools are packaged into containers for easy deployment and management across the cloud. These containers are then deployed to the cloud service, allowing for flexible scaling based on demand. Data integration with various sources like geospatial datasets and weather forecasts provides input for accurate analysis. Monitoring and management tools oversee performance and resource usage, ensuring optimal operation.
