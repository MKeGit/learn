Imagine walking through a bustling city using a navigation app that not only provides turn-by-turn directions but also leverages AI to alert you of obstacles in your path. This is just one example of how AI is enhancing accessibility for all.

AI has become a powerful tool in removing barriers and offering new opportunities. For instance, speech recognition technology can generate real-time captions, making communication more accessible. Similarly, AI tools are being developed to describe surroundings, read texts aloud, and even interpret facial expressions.

In the workplace, AI companions like Copilot are revolutionizing the way we approach tasks by assisting with code writing, document drafting, and task management, thereby increasing accessibility and productivity for everyone.

This module will dive into the multifaceted impact of AI on accessibility, exploring how it's reshaping job roles across various sectors and enhancing humanitarian efforts worldwide. Through detailed analysis and case studies, you'll gain a foundational understanding of AI's transformative potential.
