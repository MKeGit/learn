Grant management and writing is the process of finding, applying, and reporting on grants from foundations, governments, and corporations. Grant management and writing can be time-consuming and complex, especially for nonprofits and social enterprises that deal with multiple grantors and requirements. Copilot can help you with grant management and writing by providing you with:

- Opportunities: Copilot can search and filter grant opportunities that match your criteria, such as sector, location, amount, and deadline.
- Applications: Copilot can generate and edit grant applications that follow the grantor's guidelines, such as format, structure, and content.
- Reports: Copilot can create and update grant reports that demonstrate your impact, such as outcomes, indicators, and stories.

Letâ€™s consider the same nonprofit organization. To use Copilot for grant management and writing, you can simply type your request in natural language. Here are prompt examples:

```
Write a letter of inquiry requesting funding for a capital campaign, including your current 
and projected sources of income and expenses and how you plan to use the funds.
```

```
Update a grant report for our annual appeal that shows how the utility assistance program 
and clothing and housewares center have helped enable low-income families to achieve self-sufficiency.
```

```
Draft a grant application requesting funding for operating costs including staffing and supplies. 
```

Copilot produces a response that meets your request, such as a list of opportunities, an application draft, or a report summary. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.
