## Scenario

Letâ€™s consider a family services nonprofit organization helping families to be equipped with basic items. Here are some sample prompts that can be used to fundraise for our family services nonprofit:

```
Write a catchy and persuasive article for our crowdfunding campaign that emphasizes 
the urgent need for diapers in low-income families.
```

```
Create a budget for our gala dinner for 200 people, including the estimated costs of 
venue, catering, a DJ, marketing campaign, and staff.
```

```
Create a flyer for local high schools advertising the need for volunteers at our fill 
the bus diaper drive, including date, location, time slots available, and benefits of volunteering.
```

Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a list of ideas, a strategy outline, or a plan template. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.
