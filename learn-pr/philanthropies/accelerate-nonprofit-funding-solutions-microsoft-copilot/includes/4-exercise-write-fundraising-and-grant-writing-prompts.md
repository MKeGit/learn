that works with [organize cause] across the [targeted region]. Include a call to action 
at the conclusion.  
```

## Write prompts for grant management

Practice using Copilot to help draft and edit grant proposals, increasing efficiency and potentially the success rate. First, edit these prompts to fit your use-case, then ask Copilot to generate a response.

```
What are some donor segments my [cause e.g., family services] nonprofit can approach 
for grants? Target [region or zip codes] for [desired demographic]. Provide responses 
in list form. 
```

```
Compile a list of current grant opportunities in the [desired region] that support 
[your cause]. 
```

Given the responses, choose an opportunity and prompt Copilot to draft a grant proposal.
