In this exercise, you practice using Copilot to quickly create content to connect with existing and new donors.

## Donor relations prompts

Engage donors by creating personalized outreach materials and thank-you notes with Copilotâ€™s assistance. Edit these prompts for your situation.

```
Develop an agenda and outline for a roundtable discussion to engage donors and gather 
constructive feedback to improve [goal]. Include [proposed dates or timelines] and suggested 
discussion topics that generate [type of feedback desired]. 
```

```
Write a formal, yet friendly thank you email to sponsors who donated [dollar amount] in cash 
contributions over the past year. Include a real-life story that signifies the impact they are 
making in the community. Direct them to [annual report or other resource] for a detailed overview 
of our outcomes.
```

## Marketing and social media prompts

Next, practice using Copilot to manage and create content for social media platforms to boost fundraising efforts.

```
Draft a social media post tailored to the following [targeted social media outlets] amplifying 
the [event or call to action]. Encourage readers to participate and/or volunteer to help 
[intended outcome, community in need e.g., adopt an orphaned pet]. [Call to action, 
corresponding link e.g., sign up, view details]. Use catchy, persuasive language, and include hashtags.
```

Ask Copilot to generate an image for your post, remembering to specify the clear action, detailed subject, scene or setting, other elements, and specific style in your prompt.
