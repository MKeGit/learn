Marketing or social media is the process of creating and sharing compelling stories, images, and videos that showcase your impact and attract more supporters. Marketing or social media can be essential for raising awareness, building trust, and generating interest for your organization or project. Copilot can help you with marketing or social media by providing you with: 

Stories: Copilot can generate and edit stories that highlight your mission, vision, values, and impact, such as case studies, success stories, and impact stories. 

Images: Copilot can create and enhance images that illustrate your work, such as photos, graphics, and logos.

Using Copilot for marketing or social media, here are prompt examples using the family services nonprofit organization: 

```
Develop a social media strategy targeting potential donors and explain how they can make a difference 
by supporting the families in need in our community. 
```

```
Share a testimonial from a family who benefited from the support we provided and explain how others 
can help through contributions or by volunteering at the weekly food bank. 
```

```
Create a formal presentation for a fundraising pitch at our gala. Include images of the volunteers 
in action, the number of people we served last year and the amount of food, clothing, and other 
essentials we provided. 
```

Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a story text, an image file, or a video link. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples. 

Let’s try this prompt in Copilot. “Our organization is running a summer volunteer initiative for career coaching for career switchers. Can you create social media postings tailored to each of the following platforms: X/Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook?”
