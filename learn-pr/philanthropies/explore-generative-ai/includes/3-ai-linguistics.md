You may have come across some interesting AI acronyms lately such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Generation (NLG). These acronyms are a part of a branch of AI called Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

These technologies enable computers to understand, generate and respond to human language in new ways. From suggesting words while typing a message, to giving ideas for a creative project, AI provides further support for our creative endeavors. 

The video explains the meaning behind the acronyms and how this branch of AI is changing how humans interact with AI.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand and respond to human language. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved NLP applications.

LLMs are advanced AI models trained in large amounts of text data. They predict words in sequences, enabling them to perform tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, and classification.

LLMs are a key part of generative AI, which focuses on creating new content. By using LLMs, generative AI can produce human-like text, making it a useful tool in content creation.
