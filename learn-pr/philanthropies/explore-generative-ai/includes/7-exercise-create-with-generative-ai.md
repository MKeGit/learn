Now it's your turn to use generative AI. Choose the scenarios that fits your current need, and leverage generative AI to generate the content you need to make progress.

## Scenario 1: Planning a project

Use generative AI to help plan a project you're blocked on, or to provide guidance for your career development based on your goals and current skill levels.

1. **Identify a Blocked Project**: Choose a project you're currently working on or want to complete, that doesn't have a plan yet, or is blocked in some way.
2. **Generate an Outline**:
    - Use a generative AI tool to create an outline for your project.
    - Include key milestones, tasks, and deadlines.
3. **Refine the Outline**:
    - Review the generated outline and make necessary adjustments, by asking the generative AI tool to try again with the specificity you need.
    - Ensure it aligns with your project goals and constraints.

## Scenario 2: Career development guidance

Use generative AI

1. **Set Your Goals**: Define your short-term and long-term career goals.
2. **Assess Your Skills**: List your current skills and identify any gaps.
3. **Generate a Career Plan**:
    - Use a generative AI tool to create a career development plan.
    - Include steps to acquire new skills, a progression of potential job roles, and networking opportunities.
4. **Review and Adjust**:
    - Evaluate the generated plan and tailor it to your personal preferences and circumstances.
    - If the plan generated is incomplete, ask the tool to try again, this time with the components or specificity you need.

## Scenario 3: Generating images

You might want to add images to visualize your plan from one of the previous scenarios. Maybe you have a business idea that you just need a fast graphic to add to your test website and sign-up form to validate. 

1. **Plan your images**:
    - Use generative AI to generate prompts that you use to create images that represent key aspects of your project or career plan.
    - Be very specific with the style, elements, and other features of the image. The more detail you provide the better.
    - Know when to use design tools. Image generation is advancing quickly, but may not provide the kind of accuracy you need. If you have existing graphics that you need to incorporate into a new image, it might be best to use graphic design tools for the control you need.
2. **Incorporate Images**:
    - Integrate these images into your project documentation or career plan presentation.
    - Use them to enhance understanding and engagement.

## Recommendations

- **Iterate**: Continuously refine your plans and images based on feedback and new insights. Ask generative AI for an outline, then to add more specific content for each section or paragraph. If it does not produce what you need, you can ask it to try again. 
- **Collaborate**: Share your plans with peers or mentors for more input and support.
