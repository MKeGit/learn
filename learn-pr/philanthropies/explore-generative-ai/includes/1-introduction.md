Sometimes getting started on a project is hard, especially when you have a great idea, but find yourself facing writer's block. This is where generative AI services, like Microsoft Copilot, can offer valuable support. Generative AI is a newer technology that can assist in unique and innovative ways. For example, Microsoft Copilot can help you craft an opening line to hook your readers or organize your thoughts into coherent chunks. If you need inspiration for illustrations, generative AI can help with that too.

In this module, you'll explore the concepts of generative AI, discover how it differs from traditional AI, and understand the crucial role of data in unlocking its full potential. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of generative AI and how it can transform your creative process and other aspects of your life.
