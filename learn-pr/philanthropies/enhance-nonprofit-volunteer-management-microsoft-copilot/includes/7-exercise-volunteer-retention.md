In this exercise, you practice using Copilot to help draft a volunteer retention program. Start by using the prompt templates, and then create your own prompts to reinforce what you learned.

```
Develop a volunteer of the month program for [organization name] to include selection criteria, acknowledgment milestones, and award ideas.  
```

Follow up with the question: `What are some ideas to promote the new volunteer of the month program?`

## Test what you have learned: 

Feedback form: Use Copilot to help write a volunteer feedback form for your program, including your program's strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions. 

Newsletter: Use Copilot to help create a volunteer newsletter for your program, including your program's progress, achievements, and opportunities. 

Certificate: Use Copilot to help produce a volunteer certificate for your program, including your program's appreciation, gratitude, and recognition.
