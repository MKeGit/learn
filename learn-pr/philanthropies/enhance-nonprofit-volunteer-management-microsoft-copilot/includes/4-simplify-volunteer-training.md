Volunteer training is the process of providing volunteers with the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to perform their tasks effectively and safely. Volunteer training can be important for ensuring your program's quality, compliance, and satisfaction. Copilot can help you with volunteer training by providing you with:

Manuals: Copilot can generate and edit volunteer manuals that explain your program's goals, policies, and procedures.

Slide decks: Copilot can generate and edit PowerPoint slide decks that can be used to train volunteers.

Quizzes: Copilot can produce and update volunteer quizzes that assess your program's learning objectives, knowledge, and feedback.

Let’s consider the same environmental nonprofit. Here are some sample prompts that can be used for volunteer training for that organization:

```
Generate a volunteer manual for our water quality monitoring program, including the program's purpose, scope, and methodology, as well as the safety and ethical guidelines for volunteers.
```

>This prompt works best using Copilot in Word. To use Copilot in Word you will need a Microsoft Copilot Pro license.

Using Copilot in PowerPoint:

```
Reference to our volunteer manual for our Junior Conservationist program to create an hour-long session with our volunteers to train them on our policies and procedures.  
```

>[!Note]
>This prompt requires a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license.

```
Write a volunteer quiz for our wildlife conservation program, testing the volunteers' understanding of the local ecosystem, the threats facing it, and the actions they can take to protect it.
```

Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a manual, slides, or a quiz. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.

Let’s try this prompt in Copilot. “Can you create a handbook for a summer mentoring program. The handbook should outline steps in the initiation, planning, implementation and evaluation phases. It should also include a checklist for the mentees and volunteers serving as mentors outlining their responsibilities during the program. Can you include a sample schedule for 30-minute weekly check-ins.”
