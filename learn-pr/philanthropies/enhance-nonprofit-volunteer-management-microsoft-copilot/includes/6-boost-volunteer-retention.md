Volunteer retention is the process of keeping volunteers engaged and motivated to continue their involvement with your nonprofit programs. Volunteer retention can be essential for ensuring your program's continuity, loyalty, and impact. Copilot can help you with volunteer retention by providing you with: 

- Feedback forms: Copilot can generate and edit volunteer feedback forms that collect your program's strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions.
- Newsletters: Copilot can create and customize volunteer newsletters that update your program's progress, achievements, and opportunities.
- Certificates: Copilot can produce and update volunteer certificates that recognize your program's appreciation, gratitude, and recognition.

## Example scenario

Letâ€™s consider the same environmental nonprofit. Here are some sample prompts that can be used for volunteer retention for that organization:

```
Generate a volunteer feedback form for our energy efficiency program. Ask the volunteers to 
rate their satisfaction, learning, and impact, and include a space to provide comments or 
recommendations. 
```

```
Create a volunteer newsletter for our climate change program, highlighting the program's recent 
accomplishments, upcoming events, and featured stories, as well as thanking the volunteers for 
their contribution. [Insert specific details for accomplishments, events and stories here] 
```

```
Write a volunteer certificate for our renewable energy program, acknowledging the volunteer's 
name, hours, and skills, and include our gratitude and recognition for their work. 
```

Copilot will then produce a response that meets your request, such as a feedback form, a newsletter, or a certificate. You can also ask Copilot to refine, expand, or revise its response, or to provide more details or examples.
