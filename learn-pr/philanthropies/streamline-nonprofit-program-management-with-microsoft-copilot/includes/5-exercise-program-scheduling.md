In this exercise, you'll modify a prompt template to create a program schedule, and then write your own prompt for advice managing the schedule.

```
Create a Gantt chart that outlines a schedule for the [program] and assigns tasks that 
align with the [program requirements]. Include [deadlines] and task completion status. 
```

Now it's your turn. Use your imagination, ask Copilot how it can help, and then craft prompts for monitoring and communicating progress and adherence to the schedule it creates.

**Schedule management:** Use Copilot to help manage your program's schedule, including your program's changes and risks.
