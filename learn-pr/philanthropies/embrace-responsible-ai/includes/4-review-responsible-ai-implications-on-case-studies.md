|  | In a collaborative effort between Microsoft, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Seattle Children's Research Institute, a groundbreaking initiative was launched to harness Big Data and AI for pediatric research and healthcare. This initiative aimed to improve diagnosis, treatment, and overall reduction in the number of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases by utilizing AI-driven insights from electronic health records (EHRs). Microsoft processed and studied data from the CDC to identify SIDS risk factors and ways to help prevent SIDS. | Microsoft and PowerSchool are collaborating to offer personalized learning paths tailored to each learner's unique educational objectives. This partnership enhances the PowerSchool Personalized Learning Cloud by adding a feature that allows educators to generate formative assessments aligned with specific learning objectives, grade levels, subjects, and standards. In addition, it includes Adaptive Testing to provide deeper insights into individual learner requirements and the ability to monitor learner progress using assessment items generated by AI, all in accordance with educational standards. |
| Are there people or parties that this project could potentially harm or threaten? | - Patients. Patients, especially infants and their families, can benefit from improved diagnosis. However, if the AI system makes incorrect predictions or recommendations, it could potentially harm them.<br>- Healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals can benefit from the data being given to help them reach a faster diagnosis. However, they may face challenges in adapting to new technologies.<br>Data subjects. Individuals whose electronic health records (EHRs) are used for training the AI system could have their data leaked if not handled carefully. | - Learners. Learners could benefit from personalized learning, but they might be harmed if AI-generated assessments or recommendations are inaccurate, leading to educational setbacks or undue stress. Furthermore, if the AI system isn't trained carefully, it could generate biased assessments resulting in unfair treatment of certain groups of students.<br>- Educators. Educators could benefit from the tools to create more engaging learning experiences. However, they may face challenges in adapting to new technologies. |
| What responsible AI principles should be considered when implementing AI in these fields? | When implementing AI in pediatric research and healthcare, all responsible AI principles are important and relevant. The team that uses AI for SIDS research and prevention must follow responsible AI principles to ensure it's using AI ethically. | When implementing AI in an educational setting, all responsible AI principles are important and relevant. Any team using AI for creating assessment content must follow responsible AI principles to ensure it's using AI ethically. |
| How can the system ensure fairness, privacy, and responsible considerations when dealing with data? | To ensure fairness, privacy, and responsible considerations when dealing with data in this context, the following measures can be taken:<br><br>**Ensures fairness**<br>- Understand the purpose, scope, and intended users of the AI system.<br>- Make sure the data inputs come from diverse groups of people.<br>- Regularly audit the AI system for societal bias.<br><br>**Ensures privacy**<br>- Anonymize personally identifiable information (PII).<br>- >Obtain informed consent for data usage.<br>- Implement strong data security measures including encryption, access controls, and secure storage.<br>- Ensure that the AI system complies with relevant data privacy regulations and standards.<br><br>**Ensures responsible development**<br>- Establish an ethical oversight committee.<br>- Educate patients and their families about the benefits and risks of AI usage.<br>- Ensure that the system's decision-making processes are transparent. | To ensure fairness, privacy, and responsible considerations when dealing with data in this context, the following measures can be taken:<br><br>**Ensures fairness**<br>- Understand the purpose, scope, and intended users of the AI system.<br>- Regularly audit the AI system for bias.<br>- Identify potential sources of bias in the training data and algorithms and take steps to mitigate them.<br><br>**Ensures privacy**<br>- Anonymize personally identifiable information (PII).<br>- Implement strong data security measures including encryption, access controls, and secure storage.<br>- Ensure that the AI system complies with relevant data privacy regulations and standards.<br><br>**Ensures responsible development**<br>- Establish an ethical oversight committee.<br>- Educate learners and trainers about the benefits and risks of AI usage.<br>- Ensure that the system's decision-making processes are transparent. |
