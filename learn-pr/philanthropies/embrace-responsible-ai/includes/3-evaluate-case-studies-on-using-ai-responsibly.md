1. Select one of the case studies.

| Case study 1. Seattle Children's Research Institute | Case study 2. PowerSchool |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| In a collaborative effort between Microsoft, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Seattle Children's Research Institute, a groundbreaking initiative was launched to harness Big Data and AI for pediatric research and healthcare. This initiative aimed to improve diagnosis, treatment, and overall reduction in the number of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases by utilizing AI-driven insights from electronic health records (EHRs). Microsoft processed and studied data from the CDC to identify SIDS risk factors and ways to help prevent SIDS. | Microsoft and PowerSchool are collaborating to offer personalized learning paths tailored to each learner's unique educational objectives. This partnership will enhance the PowerSchool Personalized Learning Cloud by adding a feature that allows educators to generate formative assessments aligned with specific learning objectives, grade levels, subjects, and standards. In addition, it will include Adaptive Testing to provide deeper insights into individual learner requirements, and the ability to monitor learner progress using assessment items generated by AI, all in accordance with educational standards. |

## Evaluate your chosen case study

1. Open the text editor or Word document you created earlier
1. Create a new section titled Evaluate case studies on using AI responsibly
1. Answer the following questions for your selected case study. 
   - Are there people or parties who could potentially be harmed or threatened by this project?
   - What responsible AI principles should be considered when implementing AI in these fields?
   - How can the system ensure fairness, privacy, and responsible considerations when dealing with data?
