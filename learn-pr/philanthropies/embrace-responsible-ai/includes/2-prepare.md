## Project overview

In this module, you actively engage in a series of exercises designed to deepen your understanding of the Responsible AI framework. Through these exercises, you explore the ethical considerations and best practices for implementing AI systems, with the aim of bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. This ensures that you can effectively integrate the Responsible AI framework into your learning environments.

You review a couple of real-word case studies of AI application and analyze the responsible AI implications. You also analyze how the six AI principles influence the design aspects of an AI system. In the end, you work on a real-world scenario to determine the factors that an organization must consider when implementing an AI system.
