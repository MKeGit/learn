What are we enabling partners to do? to email us content in word that we then convert into publishable content? 

We should be enabling partners to join the skilling content ecosystem. The minimum surface area they can touch is GitHub, ADO, and Learn. No other tools are necessary although messaging systems are useful for notifications of progress and interactions in the other systems. 
If we do not require partners to use these systems, we are not enabling them to use the systems.
