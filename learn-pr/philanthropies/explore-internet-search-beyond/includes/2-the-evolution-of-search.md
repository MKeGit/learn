The way we search for information has evolved over time. Initially, we relied on physical books and libraries to find the information that we needed, guided by the Dewey decimal system. With the creation of the internet, keyword searches became the norm and helped us quickly find relevant information with just a few clicks. 

We've now entered the era of AI-driven queries, which have changed the way we access and interact with information. This advanced search technology uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand the context and intent behind our queries. The goal is to provide more accurate and relevant results. This shift has made searching for information more intuitive and efficient, so we can find what we need faster and with greater precision.

The way we search for information has undergone another transformation. In the past, we relied on text-based searches: typing out a question and searching through results. Today, we can search through text, voice, or even images. This flexibility has made finding information more accessible.
