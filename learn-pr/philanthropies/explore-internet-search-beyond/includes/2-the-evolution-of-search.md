The way we search for information has evolved over time. Initially, we relied on physical books and libraries to find the information we needed, guided by the Dewey decimal system. With the creation of the internet, keyword searches became the norm, allowing us to quickly find relevant information with just a few clicks. 

Today, we have entered the era of AI-driven queries, which have changed the way we access and interact with information. These advanced search technologies use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand the context and intent behind our queries, providing more accurate and relevant results. This shift has made searching for information more intuitive and efficient, allowing us to find what we need faster and with greater precision.

In this video, you'll explore the evolution of search from the pre-internet era to the present day with advanced search engines like Bing and Microsoft Copilot.
