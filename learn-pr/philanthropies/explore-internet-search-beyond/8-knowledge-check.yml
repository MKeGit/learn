  title: Knowledge check
  questions:
  - content: Which of the following best evaluates the importance of prompt engineering in AI development?
    choices:
    - content: Prompt engineering is important because it directly influences the accuracy and relevance of AI responses.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: _Prompt engineering is_ _important because it directly influences_ _accuracy and_"
    - content: Prompt engineering is a minor aspect of AI development because it only affects the initial setup.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: _This answer underestimates the ongoing impact of an effective prompt on AI performance._"
    - content: Prompt engineering is important, but not as important as data quality.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: _While data quality is important, prompt engineering is equally important for guiding AI behavior and responses._"
    - content: Prompt engineering is important for complex systems.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Prompt engineering is important for all AI systems, regardless of complexity."
  - content: "Question #2: Which of the following best assesses the effectiveness of crawling, indexing, and ranking in search engines?"
    choices:
    - content: Crawling, indexing, and ranking are effective because they ensure all web pages are included in the results.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Not all web pages are included; effectiveness is more about relevance and accuracy."
    - content: Crawling, indexing, and ranking are effective because they help search engines retrieve the most relevant results.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: This answer is correct. Crawling, indexing, and ranking are effective because they help search engines retrieve the most relevant results for use queries."
    - content: Crawling, indexing, and ranking are effective because they speed up search results.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Speed is a factor, but relevance and accuracy are more critical measures of effectiveness."
    - content: Crawling, indexing, and ranking are effective because they eliminate the need for user input making search more streamlined.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: User input is still valuable for refining and personalizing search results."
  - content: "Question #3: Which of these statements best captures the differences between a search engine and a reasoning engine?"
    choices:
    - content: A search engine uses natural language processing to understand context, whereas a reasoning engine relies on keyword matching.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Search engines and reasoning engines can both use natural language processing, or NLP. Search engines often use NLP to improve search results, where reasoning engines use NLP for logical reasoning."
    - content: A search engine primarily utilizes data analysis, while a reasoning engine is used for web browsing.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Search engines are not primarily used for data analysis; they are used for retrieving information from the web."
    - content: A search engine retrieves information based on keyword matching, whereas a reasoning engine generates new information by applying logical rules and using large language technology.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: Search engines retrieve information based on keyword matching. Reasoning engines generate new information by applying logical rules, making them suitable for tasks that require inference and decision-making."
    - content: A search engine operates on structured data, whereas a reasoning engine processes through unstructured data.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect: Search engines can operate on both structured and unstructured data. Reasoning engines can also process both types of data. Reasoning engines can also process both types of data, depending on their design and application."
