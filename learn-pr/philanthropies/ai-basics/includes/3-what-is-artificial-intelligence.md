Smart home devices, combined with the rise of useful tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft CopilotAI turned AI into a popular conversation topic. You now see AI isn't new; it's been part of our lives for years. At times, AI might seem like a new transformative force, but the evolution of AI spans decades. Along the way, it became more intertwined in our everyday lives. At its core, AI is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving. By using math and logic, AI systems can simulate human reasoning, make predictions, and take actions based on patterns in existing data.

In the first video, you'll discover what AI is and how it was first explored back in the 1950s.

Now that you know what AI is, another compelling topic is the distinction between knowledge and intelligence. While often used interchangeably, they're different concepts. In the next video, you'll learn about the distinct differences between both.

Knowledge refers to the accumulation of facts, information, and skills gained through education or experience. Intelligence is the ability to apply knowledge to think abstractly, as measured by objective criteria such as problem-solving.

AI isn't knowledgeable in the way humans are. AI systems can process, analyze, and make predictions based on the data they receive. This ability might give the impression that AI is knowledgeable, but it's different from human intelligence. AI can only simulate knowledge based on the parameters set by its programming and the data it was trained on. AI doesn't work without data; it forms the foundation of AI's abilities and determines how well it can simulate knowledge.
