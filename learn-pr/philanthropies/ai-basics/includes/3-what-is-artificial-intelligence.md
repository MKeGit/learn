# What is artificial intelligence?

AI has become a popular topic lately. However, AI isn't new; it's been part of our lives for years. At times, AI may seem like a new transformative force, but AI has evolved over decades evolving and becoming more intwined in our everyday lives. At it's core, AI is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving. By using math and logic, AI systems can simulate human reasoning, make predictions, and take actions based on patterns in existing data.

In the video below, you'll discover what AI is and how it was first explored back in the 1950s.

Now that you know what AI is, another compelling topic is the distinction between knowledge and intelligence. While often used interchangeably, they are different concepts. In the video below, you'll learn about the distinct differences between both.

Knowledge refers to the accumulation of facts, information, and skills gained through education or experience. Intelligence is the ability to apply knowledge to think abstractly, as measured by objective criteria such as problem-solving.

AI isn't knowledgeable in the way humans are. AI systems can process, analyze, and make predictions based on the data they receive. This ability might give the impression that AI is knowledgeable, but it is different from human intelligence. AI can only simulate knowledge based on the parameters set by its programming and the data it has been trained on. This is why understanding the value of data is essential; it forms the foundation of AI's abilities and determines how well it can simulate knowledge.
