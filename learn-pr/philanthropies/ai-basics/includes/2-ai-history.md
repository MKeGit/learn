## AI development timeline

The history of AI is rich and spans several decades, with significant milestones that have shaped its development. To fully until how we got to AI today, we must understand the origins of AI.

### Early concepts

The idea of using machines to assist with calculations dates back to as early as 380 BC. However, terms such as "AI" or "machine learning" are much more recent.

### The early years

In 1950, Alan Turing, a pioneer in computing, posed a profound question: "Can machines think?" This marked the beginning of a new era in technology.

The term "artificial intelligence" was first coined by computer scientist John McCarthy during the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI in 1956. This event marked the beginning of AI as a field of study.

In 1956, the Logic Theorist, considered the first AI program, was developed.

### Early developments

In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, the first AI chatbot designed to simulate conversation.

In 1968, Alexey Ivakhnenko introduced the "Group Method of Data Handling," a precursor to modern deep learning.

### 1990s

The 1990s saw significant advancements, including the development of Deep Blue, the first AI system to defeat a reigning world chess champion in 1997. This decade also saw the creation of Kismet, a robot capable of recognizing human emotions through facial expressions.

### 2000s

The 2000s brought AI into more practical and everyday applications. In 2011, IBM's Watson, a natural language AI, famously defeated two Jeopardy! champions.

This period also saw the rise of virtual assistants like Siri or Cortana.

### 2010s

The 2010s marked a significant expansion in AI capabilities and applications. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, gained prominence with breakthroughs in image and speech recognition.

### Today

AI continues to evolve rapidly, with advancements in generative AI and its integration into various aspects of daily life and industry. AI technologies are now capable of performing complex tasks, from language translation to autonomous driving.

Understanding the history of AI helps us appreciate how far the technology has come and its potential for future innovations. With the understanding of it's history, we can now ponder the question what is artificial intelligence?
