# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. While NLP is part of AI, it is distinct from machine learning. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions, while NLP involves understanding, interpreting, and generating human language. NLP can use machine learning techniques, but it also includes many other methods and approaches.

Key concepts in NLP include text analysis, question answering, conversational language, and speech recognition and synthesis.

In the video below, you'll be introduced to the process of NLP and how it is transforming the way we interact with technology.

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret and generate human language. It encompasses various capabilities such as sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, named entity recognition, text summarization, and real-time translation. NLP applications span customer service, healthcare, business intelligence, and content management. These NLP capabilities are often powered by AI algorithms.
