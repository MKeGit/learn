# AI algorithms

AI algorithms are the backbone of many technologies we use today. They power household items like smart speakers, which use voice recognition to understand commands, and smart thermostats, which learn your preferences to adjust the temperature automatically.

AI algorithms enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These algorithms are sequences of calculations and rules used to solve problems or analyze data, each suited for specific tasks. For instance, machine learning algorithms can learn from data to make predictions, while deep learning algorithms use multiple layers of neural networks to analyze large datasets.

In the video below, you'll learn about different AI algorithms and how they are being used today.
