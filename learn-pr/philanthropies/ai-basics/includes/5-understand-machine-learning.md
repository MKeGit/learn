# Understand machine learning

Machine learning involves feeding large amounts of data into an algorithm, which then processes this data to find patterns and relationships.

For example, if you provide an AI model with data about your past vacuuming habits and the layout of your home, the model can learn to predict the most efficient cleaning routes for your robot vacuum cleaner. This way, the vacuum can optimize its path to ensure thorough and efficient cleaning based on the patterns it has learned.

Machine learning is an AI technique that uses algorithms to create predictive models. These models are validated against known data, measured by specific metrics, and adjusted as needed. This process of learning and validation is called training. Through retraining, machine learning models improve overtime. There are also key methodologies on how to train models for example structure learning, unstructured learning, and reinforcement learning.

In the video below, you'll learn the difference between these different methodologies.
