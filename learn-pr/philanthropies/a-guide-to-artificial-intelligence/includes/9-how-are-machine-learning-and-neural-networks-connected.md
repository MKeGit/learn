Although neural networks are considered a subset of machine-learning models, some significant differences exist between neural networks and other machine-learning models.

Neural networks are more complex and capable of operating independently than regular machine-learning models.<sup>6</sup> For example, a neural network can determine whether its predictions and outcomes are accurate.

Additionally, neural networks are structured so that they can continue to learn and make predictions without directions. Machine-learning models, on the other hand, are limited to on what the model was specifically trained.<sup>6</sup>
