Suppose you're one of the developers working on the Contoso Pets adoption application to help find new homes for pets. Your starting version of the application gathers a single search term used to search the descriptions of dogs. A single term search is helpful, but the feedback given from the team is the application needs more search functionality. The team wants you to extend the search functionality to allow for multiple term searches. Additionally, the team wants to pilot an update to the "search status" animation that shows search progress.

In this challenge coding project, your C# data knowledge and skills are applied for:

- Creating string arrays by splitting strings
- Manipulating array data, iterating through elements in an array, and sorting array data
- Modifying and building strings from multiple data sources

In short, you'll:

- Develop multi-term search functionality for the "dogs" search
- Update the "search status" animation, information and countdown

By the end of this module, you complete an updated version of the Contoso Pets application that searches all dogs available for adoption using multiple search terms and an improved search status simulation.
