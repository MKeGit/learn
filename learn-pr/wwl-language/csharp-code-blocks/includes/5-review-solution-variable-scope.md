The following code is one possible solution for the challenge from the previous unit:

```c#
int[] numbers = { 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 };
int total = 0;
bool found = false;

foreach (int number in numbers)
{
    total += number;
    if (number == 42)
        found = true;
}

if (found)
    Console.WriteLine("Set contains 42");

Console.WriteLine($"Total: {total}");
```

This code is merely "*one possible solution*" because you may have added line feeds in different spots, and you may have formatted the code differently.

The biggest changes to the problematic code included:

- Moving the declaration of the `total` and `found` variables outside of the `foreach` statement.
- Initializing both the `total` and `found` variables with sensible default values.
- Removing the code blocks (curly braces) from the `if` statements.

No matter how you formatted the code, when you run the code, you should see the following output:

```Output
Set contains 42
Total: 108
```

If you were successful, congratulations! Continue on to the knowledge check in the next unit.
