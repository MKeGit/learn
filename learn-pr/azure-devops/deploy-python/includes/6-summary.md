Great work! In this module, you built a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines that deploys a Python application to Azure. The pipeline automatically runs whenever you merge a change to the `main` branch of your Git repository on GitHub, and then validates the deployment by running functional tests.

While this module specifically focused on a Python app deployed to Azure App Service, the fundamentals we covered here apply across a wide range of build and deployment targets. You can also see how Azure Pipelines can scale to support your specific requirements.

## Learn more

In this module, you worked with Python, which is just one of the many platforms Azure supports natively. To learn about support and tutorials for different developer platforms, see [Build applications with Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/developer/?azure-portal=true).

In addition to supporting multiple platforms, Azure also provides a variety of resources that can be used from Python solutions. For a learning path full of examples on how to use Python with Azure's data analysis and machine learning tools, see [Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks](../../../paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/index.yml?azure-portal=true). You might also be interested in using Python with Azure AI services, which is covered in [Build an AI web app by using Python and Flask](/training/modules/python-flask-build-ai-web-app/?azure-portal=true).

If you are new to Python, check out the learning path [Python for beginners](../../../paths/beginner-python/index.yml?azure-portal=true). It includes hours of instructional modules like that help you get started with the basics of building Python applications.

In this module, you ran a functional test that uses Selenium. To learn more about functional tests, including how to write a Selenium test, see [Run functional tests in Azure Pipelines](/training/modules/run-functional-tests-azure-pipelines/?azure-portal=true).
