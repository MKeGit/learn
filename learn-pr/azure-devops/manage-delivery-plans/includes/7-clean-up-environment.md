Now that you're done with the tasks for this module, clean up your Azure DevOps environment.

## Optional - Delete your project

This module provided a template that you ran to create a clean environment for the module.

Delete your Azure DevOps project, including what's in Azure Boards. In future modules, you can run another template that brings up a new project in a state where this module leaves off. Choose this option if you don't need your DevOps project for future reference.

To delete the project:

1. In Azure DevOps, go to your project. Earlier we recommended that you name this project **Space Game - web - Delivery plans**.
1. Select **Project settings** in the lower corner.
1. At the bottom of the **Project details** area, select **Delete**.
