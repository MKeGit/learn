In this module, the Tailspin team took on some common organizational challenges around software delivery and adapted their process to better handle them. Some of the things you learned to do with Azure DevOps include how to:

* Create a delivery plan.
* Add team sprints and milestones to a delivery plan.
* Rearrange work items to fit the overall schedule.
* View dependencies between work items in a delivery plan.
* Resolve dependencies that have issues.

## Learning path summary

Congratulations. You've completed the final module in the _Get started with Azure DevOps_ learning path. In this learning path, you:

* Saw how a value stream map can help you examine your existing processes and technologies.
* Saw what DevOps is (and isn't) and created an Azure DevOps organization.
* Learned how Azure Boards helps teams plan the work that needs to be done. You used the Basic process to set up a basic backlog of tasks you'll work on in upcoming modules.
* Learned how to optimize sprint workloads across multiple Agile teams.
* Learned how to view and track dependencies within and across several Agile teams.

## Continue the journey

You've seen the team identify their top-priority problems, but how will they solve them? If you want to work along with them and learn how to configure build pipelines that continuously build, test, and verify your applications, go to [Build applications with Azure DevOps](../../../paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops/index.yml?azure-portal=true).

For more self-paced, hands-on learning around Azure DevOps, also check out [Azure DevOps Labs](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com?azure-portal=true).

## Learn more

This module focused on how delivery plans can help you manage work schedules across multiple teams. However, there are many things to consider when coordinating projects at scale.

To learn more about some of the other features Azure DevOps provides for scaling your team projects, such as team hierarchies, project portfolio management, and dashboards, see [Plan for Agile at scale](/azure/devops/boards/plans/?azure-portal=true).
