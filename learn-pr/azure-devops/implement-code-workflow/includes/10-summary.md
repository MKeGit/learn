In this module, you learned how to collaborate with others by using Git and GitHub.

Andy and Mara are well on their way to implementing a system that will allow them to better collaborate as a team and help ensure that only quality code is merged to the `main` branch.

A build badge and dashboard widgets help the team and others understand the latest build state and track the build history over time.

Although Andy and Mara are the primary code contributors, setting up a rule on GitHub to require a review is a good way to enforce a disciplined code review practice. Even minor errors can cause a build to break. As an example, you watched a typing error make its way through the build and into the hands of the QA team.

### Explore tools that simplify the Git and GitHub workflow

In this module, you made basic changes to the _Space Game_ website. In practice, your changes will likely be much more complex. Although you can do everything you need from the command line, there are many tools you can use to simplify the workflow. Here are two that we recommend:

* Visual Studio Code includes Git support in-the-box. Here are resources where you can learn more:
  * [Using Git source control in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview)
  * [Working with GitHub in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com?azure-portal=true) is another great way to branch, commit, and visually compare and commit your changes.

### Learn more about Git

Although you can learn Git with just a few commands, full mastery will let you perform more complex types of merges and understand the history of your code base.

[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com?azure-portal=true) and the book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2?azure-portal=true) are two excellent resources for learning more about Git.

### Define your workflow

The workflow you used in this module is a standard way to get started. Your team can refine it to suit your needs. You'll find many resources and perspectives on the web from various teams with varying needs.

[Understanding the GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) introduces an approach that's similar to what you saw in this module, and it includes tips that you can apply to your own workflow.

[A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model?azure-portal=true) proposes a more advanced branching and merging strategy.

[How to Split Pull Requests](https://www.thedroidsonroids.com/blog/splitting-pull-request?azure-portal=true) describes how to split large pull requests into smaller ones to help others more easily understand your changes.

[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit?azure-portal=true) teaches you how to be a better collaborator by writing effective commit messages.

[Specify events that trigger pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/build/triggers) explains how triggers enable you to control which files or Git branches cause a build to occur.
