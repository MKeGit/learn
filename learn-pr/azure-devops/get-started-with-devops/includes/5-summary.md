In this module, you learned about what DevOps is (and what it's *not*) and about the Microsoft DevOps suite, Azure DevOps. You also set up an account in Azure DevOps and created an organization.

In a comparison between elite performers and low performers, elite performers deploy more frequently, more quickly, and with fewer failures. This mindset helps them better adapt to changing market conditions, experiment with new features, and recover from incidents with greater resiliency. DevOps gives you a path to become an elite performer.

Even for elite performers, change happens gradually, often starting with the most immediate challenges or pain points. Adopting DevOps practices takes time.
