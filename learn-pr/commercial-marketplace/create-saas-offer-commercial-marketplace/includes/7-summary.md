Today, we spent some time covering software as a service (SaaS) offer basics for the commercial marketplace. We started with an overview of SaaS benefits, highlighting the efficiencies that SaaS enables for you and your customers. You learned where customers can find SaaS offers in the commercial marketplace and the different ways you can engage with new customers. We also explored the components of a SaaS offer to help you get ready to create your own.
