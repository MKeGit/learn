Your exploration into the Microsoft commercial marketplace yields valuable insights on how your company can use it to find new customers and drive revenue growth. You summarize your findings during a presentation to your leadership team.

You start your presentation by discussing the different ways that your customers can find, try, buy, and deploy your solutions online through **Microsoft AppSource**, **Azure Marketplace**, and in-product experiences within Microsoft products such as Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, the Power Platform, and Azure.

Next, you demonstrate to your team the many ways you can engage with your customers through the commercial marketplace by publishing your offer as different **listing types** in the online catalog.

At the end of the presentation, you give an overview of Microsoft initiatives like **Marketplace Rewards**, highlighting how the benefits are strategically designed to help accelerate customer discovery and revenue growth for Microsoft's partners.

Your initial presentation to the executive team is met with enthusiasm! Following your presentation, they ask you take the first steps of your Microsoft commercial marketplace journey.
