quiz:
  questions:
  - content: What do you need to add a reference from your test project to product code?
    choices:
    - content: "Add a reference to the target project."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. That's only one of the necessary tasks."
    - content: "Both import the namespace and add a project reference."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! You need to both import the namespace and add a reference to the project that you want to test."
    - content: "Import the namespace, add a project reference, and add the @test decorator on the test method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The @test decorator is a Java idiom. .NET uses [TestMethod], but this decorator is normally included as part of the template."
  - content: Which of the following causes a test to fail?
    choices:
    - content: "A failing assert statement is the only reason a test would fail."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tests can fail even if all the assert statements are passing."
    - content: "A test fails when *most* assertions in the test are failing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tests will fail if there's at least one failing assertion."
    - content: "Tests can fail for various reasons, including at least one failing assertion, an uncaught exception, or test time-out."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! There are several reasons a test may fail. Always check the test output to determine the cause of a failure."
