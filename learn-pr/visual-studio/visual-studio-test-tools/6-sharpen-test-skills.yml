quiz:
  questions:
  - content: Say you have one method that you want to test with multiple inputs. What test tool can help you?
    choices:
    - content: "Data-driven tests"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You're correct! Data-driven tests can reduce repetition in your code by letting you run a test with multiple inputs."
    - content: "Mocking"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
    - content: "No framework is needed. I should copy and paste the test multiple times and change only the parameters."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
  - content: Stubs and shims are found in what test tool?
    choices:
    - content: "Fluent Assertions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
    - content: "Data-driven tests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite! Try again."
    - content: "Mocking"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Mocking uses stubs and shims to isolate code so you're testing only one specific piece of your project at a time."
