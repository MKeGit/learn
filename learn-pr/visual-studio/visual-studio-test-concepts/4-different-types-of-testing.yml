quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What is the most common type of test?"
    choices:
    - content: "Integration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Close! Integration tests are likely the second most common type of test, because they're one step up from testing individual functions."
    - content: "UI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "UI tests are often less common because they've historically been more expensive to maintain, run, and write."
    - content: "Unit"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Unit tests are the most common type of tests in sheer number, because they're the easiest to write and least expensive to run."
  - content: "If I want to test how my app scales with multiple users using it, what type of test am I likely to write?"
    choices:
    - content: "Load"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Load testing will help predict how your app does at scale, when multiple customers are actually using it in the real world."
    - content: "Integration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Integration tests can test how multiple parts of your code integrate together, but won't mimic multiple users using the app."
    - content: "Performance"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Close! Performance testing is considered similar to this type of testing. It does focus on how responsive your functions are, but there's a more specific type of test that mimics multiple users putting your app under stress to find its limits."
