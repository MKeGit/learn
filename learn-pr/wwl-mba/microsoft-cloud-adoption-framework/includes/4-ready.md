To prepare for cloud adoption, you must set up your environment and create landing zones to host your workloads.

Use the Ready methodology of the Cloud Adoption Framework to help guide the following aspects of preparation:

- Set up your Azure environment.
- Define a cloud operating model.
- Implement landing zones.
- Consider operational aspects.
- Develop necessary skills.
- Avoid common antipatterns.

Implement these elements to create a strong foundation for cloud adoption. The [Azure setup guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-setup-guide/) offers step-by-step instructions to help you organize resources, control costs, and secure your environment before you deploy solutions.

## Define a cloud operating model

A cloud operating model defines how you want to operate technology in the cloud. The key components of an operating model include alignment to business strategy, organization of people, change management (or adoption processes), operations management, governance and compliance, and security. A cloud operating model shifts the focus from hardware to digital assets and workloads. The purpose of an operating model is to ensure consistent operations.

## Implement landing zones

Landing zones provide a scalable and modular environment to help you manage your cloud environment. They provide a foundation for security, governance, and resource management. The landing zone implementation that you choose depends on your organizational needs, customizations that you require, and how you use various technologies. After you implement your landing zones, you must optimize your landing zone operations as you scale.
Continuous optimizations can help:

- Identify and eliminate unnecessary expenses.
- Enhance the performance of applications and services.
- Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that the landing zone can scale efficiently to meet new demands.
- Maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations.
- Create reliable and resilient systems.

## Develop necessary skills

Cloud adoption requires that you have the required technical skills and organizational roles. Microsoft provides [learning paths](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/suggested-skills#environmental-technical-readiness-learning-paths) that your team can use to help develop necessary skills. You must [align your teams with cloud adoption functions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/suggested-skills#organizational-readiness-learning-paths), which might require that you establish a new organizational structure or assign new roles.

## Avoid cloud adoption antipatterns

Common antipatterns during the readiness phase can hinder your cloud adoption efforts. These antipatterns include inadequate preparation, miconception about cloud service features, and lack of knowledge about cloud provider operations. Effectively avoid these pitfalls to help ensure a smooth and successful cloud adoption process.

By following the guidance provided in the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework, you can develop a comprehensive and effective readiness plan that aligns with your business goals and ensures a successful transition to the cloud.
