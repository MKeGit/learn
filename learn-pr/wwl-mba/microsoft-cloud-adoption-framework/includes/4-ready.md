This article summarizes key aspects of the readiness phase, including setting up your Azure environment, understanding cloud operating models, implementing landing zones, considering operational aspects, developing necessary skills, and avoiding common antipatterns.

The readiness phase is crucial for building a strong foundation for cloud adoption. It involves preparing your environment and creating landing zones to host workloads. The Azure Setup Guide offers step-by-step instructions to help you organize resources, control costs, and secure your environment before deploying solutions.

## Understanding Cloud Operating Models
A cloud operating model defines how you want to operate technology in the cloud. It shifts the focus from hardware to digital assets and workloads, ensuring consistent operations. The Cloud Operating Model section of the framework provides guidance on developing operational maturity and aligning your cloud strategy with business goals.

## Implementing Landing Zones
Landing zones are essential for a well-managed cloud environment. They provide a foundation for security, governance, and resource management. The Landing Zone Implementation Options article outlines various approaches to setting up landing zones, including enterprise-scale foundations and modular deployments. Additionally, the Landing Zone Operations article offers guidance on managing and optimizing landing zones as you scale.

## Landing Zone Operations
Effective landing zone operations are critical for maintaining a secure and efficient cloud environment. The Landing Zone Operations article provides guidance on improving operations as you scale, helping you meet growing operational excellence, reliability, and performance requirements. It emphasizes the importance of establishing a management baseline and extending your management capabilities to build extra resiliency.

## Developing Necessary Skills
Cloud adoption requires new skills and roles within your organization. The Suggested Skills article provides a roadmap for developing the necessary expertise to support cloud adoption. It includes resources for learning about Azure services, organizational alignment, and skill development.

## Avoiding Cloud Adoption Antipatterns
Common antipatterns during the readiness phase can hinder your cloud adoption efforts. These include inadequate preparation, misaligned operating models, and ineffective governance. The Ready Antipatterns article discusses these pitfalls and offers solutions to avoid them, ensuring a smooth and successful cloud adoption process.

By following the guidance provided in the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework, you can develop a comprehensive and effective readiness plan that aligns with your business goals and ensures a successful transition to the cloud.
