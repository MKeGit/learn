This module summarizes key aspects of the adoption phase, including cloud adoption strategies, migration and modernization, innovation, and relocation.

The cloud adoption phase encompasses various strategies to help you transition to the cloud. The framework guides you through different processes such as migrating, modernizing, innovating, and relocating workloads. Each process aligns with distinct phases in the cloud adoption journey, each with specific goals, solutions, and benefits. This comprehensive approach ensures that you can meet business demands, exit on-premises environments, and align with Azure Well-Architected Framework principles.

## Migration and Modernization
Migration involves moving workloads to the cloud or between clouds. The migration guidance helps you choose the migration strategy that best aligns with your objectives, whether it's meeting business demands, exiting an on-premises environment, or aligning with Azure Well-Architected Framework principles. Modernization, on the other hand, focuses on updating existing applications and infrastructure to take full advantage of cloud capabilities. This process can lower the total cost of ownership (TCO) while driving security, performance, and efficiency.

## Innovation
Innovation in the cloud adoption framework focuses on understanding customer needs and rapidly building innovations that shape how customers interact with your products. This phase involves creating hypotheses with business value consensus and building minimum viable products (MVPs) to test these hypotheses. By leveraging cloud-native tools and modern application platforms, you can unlock new technical skills and expanded business capabilities, ultimately driving greater business value.

## Relocation
Relocation is the process of moving a workload or workload component in Azure to a different Azure region. This type of migration has its own solutions and considerations, distinct from traditional migration processes. The relocation guidance outlines the steps to set up a relocation project, evaluate workloads for relocation, and implement the relocation using automation tools like infrastructure as code (IaC) and Azure Resource Mover. Effective relocation ensures that workloads are optimized for performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency in their new regions.

By following the guidance provided in the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework, you can develop a comprehensive and effective cloud adoption plan that aligns with your business goals and ensures a successful transition to the cloud.
