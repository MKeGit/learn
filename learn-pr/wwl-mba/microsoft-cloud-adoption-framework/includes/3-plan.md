This article summarizes key aspects of the plan methodology, including rationalizing your digital estate, initial organizational alignment, adapting roles and skills, planning for sustainability, and avoiding common antipatterns.

Your cloud adoption plan is an iterative project plan that helps you transition from traditional IT approaches to modern, agile methodologies. This plan aligns your business objectives with technical efforts, ensuring that transitions are managed and communicated effectively.

## Rationalizing the Digital Estate

Rationalizing your digital estate involves inventorying and assessing your current IT assets to determine their suitability for cloud migration. This process helps you prioritize workloads for migration and develop a clear roadmap for your cloud journey. Incremental rationalization is recommended to reduce risks and manage transitions more efficiently.

## Initial Organizational Alignment

Aligning your organization is crucial for the success of your cloud adoption plan. This involves establishing a structure where people are accountable for cloud adoption and governance. Initial organizational alignment ensures that the right stakeholders are engaged and that there is a balance between speed and control during the adoption process.

## Adapting Roles, Skills, and Processes

Cloud adoption requires adapting existing roles, skills, and processes to support the new environment. You must identify skill gaps and provide training or acquire new talent to fill these gaps. This ensures that your workforce is prepared to support the digital transformation and manage the cloud environment effectively.

## Planning for Sustainability

Sustainability is an important consideration in cloud adoption planning. You should identify your current emissions and plan to reduce your carbon footprint by optimizing resource usage and energy consumption. This not only helps in achieving corporate social responsibility goals but also improves brand reputation and compliance with industry standards.

## Data Warehouse Migration

Migrating data warehouses to the cloud involves several steps, including preparation, migration strategy, and execution. You must thoroughly research and plan the migration to avoid unwelcome surprises and unplanned costs. This includes setting up a proof of concept, managing test and production environments, and ensuring data security during the migration.

## Avoiding Cloud Adoption Plan Antipatterns

Common antipatterns during the planning phase can hinder your cloud adoption efforts. These include choosing the wrong cloud operating model, misaligned operating models, and replacing architecture instead of modernizing it. Recognizing and avoiding these antipatterns is essential for ensuring a smooth and successful cloud adoption process.
