This unit summarizes key aspects of the plan methodology, including rationalizing your digital estate, initial organizational alignment, adapting roles and skills, planning for sustainability, and avoiding common antipatterns.

Your cloud adoption plan is an iterative project plan that helps you transition from traditional IT approaches to modern, agile methodologies. This plan aligns your business objectives with technical efforts, ensuring that transitions are managed and communicated effectively.

## Rationalize the digital estate

To rationalize your digital estate, inventory and assess your current IT assets to determine their suitability for cloud migration. This process helps you prioritize workloads for migration and develop a clear roadmap for your cloud journey. Incrementally rationalize your digital estate to reduce risks and manage transitions more efficiently.

## Align your organization

Align your organization to help ensure the success of your cloud adoption plan. You should etablish a structure where people are accountable for cloud adoption and governance. Initial organizational alignment ensures that you engage the right stakeholders and create a balance between speed and control during the adoption process.

## Adapt roles, skills, and processes

Cloud adoption requires that you adapt existing roles, skills, and processes to support the new environment. You must identify skill gaps and provide training or acquire new talent to fill these gaps. Have a prepared workforce that can support the digital transformation and manage the cloud environment effectively.

## Plan for sustainability

Consider sustainability when you create your cloud adoption plan. Identify your current emissions, and plan to reduce your carbon footprint. For example, you can optimize resource usage and energy consumption. This practice helps you achieve corporate social responsibility goals and improve brand reputation and compliance with industry standards.

## Migrate your data warehouses

Data warehouse migration to the cloud involves several steps, including preparation, migration strategy, and implementation. You must thoroughly research and plan the migration to avoid unwelcome surprises and unplanned costs. During this process, you should set up a proof of concept, manage test and production environments, and ensure data security during the migration.

## Avoid cloud adoption plan antipatterns

Common antipatterns during the planning phase can hinder your cloud adoption efforts. These antipatterns include choosing the wrong cloud operating model, misaligned operating models, and replacing architecture instead of modernizing it. Recognize and avoid these antipatterns to ensure a smooth and successful cloud adoption process.
