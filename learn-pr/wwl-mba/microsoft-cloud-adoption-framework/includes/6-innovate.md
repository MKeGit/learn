The Cloud Adoption Framework Innovate methodology helps you understand customer needs and rapidly build innovations that improve how your customers interact with your products.

Before you determine technical solutions, identify how new innovations can drive business value. Determine the customer need that you want the solution to address and how the solution benefits your business.

At this stage, you might have misalignment between customer needs and business opportunities, motivations and outcomes, or among team members or departments. Alignment in these areas helps create a cohesive, focused, productive environment that drives success. Consider and implement [approaches to address any misalignment](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/business-value#address-solution-alignment).

After you define and align your solution, you can integrate it into your application. You can build your first minimum viable product (MVP). An MVP is a version of a product that has just enough features for early customers to use. The customers provide feedback for future product development. The goal of every MVP is to test your solution and to receive feedback directly from the customer. In each iteration and with each release, you improve the solution toward your scale-ready solution that represents multiple disciplines of invention.

To determine the success of your solution, you should define business metrics. Business metrics are quantifiable metrics that you can use to track and assess a specific business goal. Generally, your business metrics align with the [motivations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/motivations) and [business outcomes](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/) that you defined in the Strategy methodology. Your strategic metrics might align with one or more of the following outcome areas:

- [Business agility](../../strategy/business-outcomes/agility-outcomes.md)
- [Customer engagement](../../strategy/business-outcomes/engagement-outcomes.md)
- [Customer reach](../../strategy/business-outcomes/reach-outcomes.md)
- [Financial impact](../../strategy/business-outcomes/fiscal-outcomes.md)
- [Solution performance](../../strategy/business-outcomes/fiscal-outcomes.md), in the case of operational innovation


Successful innovation aligns with your strategic goals.
