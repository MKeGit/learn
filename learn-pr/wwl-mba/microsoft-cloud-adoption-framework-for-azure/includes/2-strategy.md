This module summarizes key aspects of the strategy methodology, including motivations, business outcomes, financial and technical considerations, building a business case, sharing your strategy, and avoiding common antipatterns.

The Strategy methodology helps organizations identify their position in the digital transformation journey, recognize opportunities for cloud adoption, and develop a strategy around business, people, and technology. This foundational step ensures that cloud adoption efforts align with overall business goals.

## Motivations for cloud adoption

Understand the motivations behind your cloud adoption to guide decision-making and ensure alignment with business objectives. Common motivations include:
- improving business agility
- reducing costs
- accelerating time to market
- enabling expansion into new markets

Clearly defining these motivations helps organizations create a focused and effective cloud adoption strategy.

## Defining Business Outcomes

Business outcomes are the measurable results that organizations aim to achieve through cloud adoption. These outcomes should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Documenting business outcomes helps ensure transparency and fosters cross-functional partnerships. The business outcome framework provides a template for capturing and aligning these outcomes with cloud adoption efforts.

## Financial and technical Considerations

A digital transformation goes hand-in-hand with a financial transformation. When shifting to the cloud, organizations must consider how the cloud will impact their financial position, accounting KPIs, and processes. The cloud's pay-for-what-you-consume model offers a flexible cost structure compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure. Developing a financial model that includes total cost of ownership (TCO) and return on investment (ROI) is essential for building a robust business case.

Technical considerations are critical when planning cloud adoption. These include understanding the fundamental principles of cloud economics, aligning partner strategies, and addressing technical dependencies for hybrid and multicloud operations. Organizations must also consider DevOps practices, security, and compliance requirements to ensure a smooth transition to the cloud.

## Building a Business Case

Creating a business case for cloud migration involves developing a migration strategy and conducting a financial analysis. This process helps justify the move to the cloud by demonstrating potential cost savings and business benefits. The Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator can assist organizations in assessing their overall strategy and identifying areas for optimization.

## Sharing Your Strategy

Effectively communicating your cloud adoption strategy is crucial for gaining stakeholder buy-in and ensuring alignment across the organization. Sharing the strategy involves documenting motivations, business outcomes, and the financial model, and presenting this information to key stakeholders. This step helps build consensus and support for the cloud adoption journey.

## Avoiding Strategy Antipatterns

Common antipatterns during the strategy phase can complicate the alignment of IT and business strategies. These include:
- adopting the cloud without establishing clear goals
- failing to communicate motivations
- choosing the wrong cloud operating model

Recognizing and avoiding these antipatterns is essential for ensuring a successful cloud adoption process.
