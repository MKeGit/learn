- Reasons why the SaaS model is popular, such as high customer demand for the consumption model, faster time to market for new functionality, and better security.
- The LAER consumption model, and why adoption is at its core. How adoption affects churn and company financial results.
- Difference between SLA and SLOs, and how to define SLOs for your solution.

To get started with your SaaS business, first make your business-level decisions.

- What's the purpose of your product?

The answers to these questions provide the requirements for your SaaS solution, as when defining the target market segment for the Contoso SaaS solution.

The approach each company takes depends on many factors, including the current stage of business. Some startups or new software companies first need to find product market fit and define a sustainable business model that's ready for growth and scale.
