This dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of articles of clothing: 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are square and contain 28 &times; 28 = 784 pixels, where each pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255. Each of these images is associated with a label, which is an integer between 0 and 9 that classifies the article of clothing.
