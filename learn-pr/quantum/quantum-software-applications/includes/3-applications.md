The application layer focuses on solving specific problems using quantum algorithms. This is where quantum computing's potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery is realized. Similar to QPU and hardware development, this remains an active and evolving area of research. This research feeds into the overall development of the quantum stack. As we learn more about the use cases for quantum computers, we gain better insights into how to build and optimize them, and vice versa. Here, we explore a few applications for quantum computers in greater detail.

### Revolutionizing drug discovery & healthcare

One of the most exciting research areas for quantum computing is the possibility of developing new treatments for sick patients. Today, developing new treatments is lengthy and expensive. It can take decades and billions of dollars to bring a new drug to market. This approach isn't only expensive for the patient, but also costs lives. Many patients who may benefit from the new treatments never get to receive the new medication.

Quantum computing has the potential to change this situation. It allows scientists to simulate complex molecules in a currently impossible way, giving them new tools to explore many chemicals quickly. By simulating potential molecules and their properties, quantum computers accelerate drug development and enable better drugs to reach patients quickly. This could be transformative for personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to individual genetic profiles, potentially leading to more effective and targeted therapies.

Moreover, quantum computing could revolutionize the design of complex biological systems. For instance, simulating protein folding and interactions accurately is a challenge for classical computers due to the sheer number of possible configurations. Quantum computers could handle these simulations more efficiently, aiding in the understanding of diseases at a molecular level and leading to the development of new therapeutic strategies.

### Materials

Another area where quantum computers could potentially provide revolutionary change is materials science. As in drug discovery, quantum computers are able to simulate and analyze complex molecular and atomic interactions with unprecedented precision. Classical computers struggle with the huge complexity of modeling these quantum systems.

The power of quantum computers to simulate such systems allow scientists to predict and manipulate the properties of new materials. This computational power will hopefully lead to breakthrough discoveries in areas such as high-temperature superconducting, battery technology, and catalysts for chemical reactions. For example, discovering new materials with higher conductivity at room temperature could revolutionize electronics and energy transmission. Similarly, more efficient batteries could enable longer-lasting electric vehicles and better energy storage solutions, contributing to a more sustainable future.

### Optimization

Quantum computing holds immense promise for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable for classical computers. Optimization is crucial in many industries, including logistics, finance, and manufacturing. For instance, in logistics, quantum algorithms could optimize delivery routes and schedules more efficiently than current methods, reducing costs and improving service levels. In finance, quantum computing could enhance portfolio optimization, risk management, and fraud detection, leading to more stable and efficient markets.

It's easy to conclude that the development of useful quantum computers transform many aspects of our lives. With many applications yet to be discovered, this is an incredibly exciting time to get involved. Whether thatâ€™s building quantum applications, designing better RF electronics or enabling millions to access these machines through the cloud, we need people of all backgrounds to lend their expertise and breathe life into quantum computers.
