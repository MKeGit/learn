Quantum entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits are sharing information about their states, in such a way that qubits can't be described as individual subsystems. Quantum entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum computing and it can be also a powerful tool. 

In this module, you transfer the state of a qubit from one location to another without physically moving the qubit itself. This process, known as quantum teleportation, relies heavily on the principles of quantum entanglement. You'll use Q# and the Azure Quantum Development Kit to create and manipulate entangled qubits. To perform the teleportation, you use operations like Controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard (H), and Pauli X and Z to create Bell states.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the concept of quantum entanglement.
- Understand the quantum teleportation protocol.
- Apply single-qubit and multi-qubit operations using Q#.
- Create and manipulate entangled qubits using Q#.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of quantum computing concepts.
- Advanced knowledge of linear algebra and Dirac notation.
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or open [Visual Studio Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/).
- The latest version of the [Azure Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode) extension.

## Recommended learning

To get the most out of this module, it's recommended to have the [Explore quantum superposition with Q#](xref:learn.quantum.explore-superposition) module completed. This module introduces the basic concepts of Dirac notation, qubit states, and quantum gates.
