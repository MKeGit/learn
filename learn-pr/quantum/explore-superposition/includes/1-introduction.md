Quantum mechanics introduces concepts that challenge our classical understanding of physics. One of the key concepts is the principle of superposition, a phenomenon where a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This foundational idea is crucial for grasping the behavior of qubits in quantum computing, which operate under different rules than traditional bits.


## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Define the concepts of quantum superposition, probabilities, and Bloch sphere.
- Understand Dirac notation.
- Use Q# to apply operations and create superposition states.
- Use Q# to inspect the current state of a qubit.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of linear algebra and complex numbers.
- The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or open [VS Code on the Web](https://vscode.dev/).
- The latest version of the [Azure Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.qsharp-lang-vscode) extension.
