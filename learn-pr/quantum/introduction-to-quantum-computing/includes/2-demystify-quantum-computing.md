Though poorly understood by the public, quantum computers are well within the reach of developers, and now is the perfect time to learn more about your future role in this exciting industry.  

While building technology that combines quantum mechanics with computing is extremely complex, the underlying principles are not magic or unexplainable. The laws of quantum mechanics may seem weird, but they are well-understood and experimentally tested.  

We are about to enter a fascinating era when quantum computing moves from academic things of curiosity to useful applications and products, joining the host of computing power we enjoy today. We will be able to solve some of the world’s most significant challenges, and you can become part of that story by building the foundational software that will ultimately become an essential part of cloud technology.  

Taking this course will allow you to learn more about this industry and can provide insight into topics such as:

- Why becoming a quantum computing developer is a fantastic opportunity.
- Why now is a critical moment to learn these skills.
- Where learners can go to learn more.

This will help you unlock a lucrative and exciting career path – not to mention the opportunity to be part of an unparalleled story in our lifetime. With an understanding of some basic principles and existing expertise in common programming languages, developers can apply their skills towards a new range of challenges.  

During this course, we will break down the science and enable you to join others in building a revolution in computational power driven by Quantum Computers. You don’t have to be a physicist to understand quantum computing, and if we want to leverage their full potential, it probably helps if you're not!  

Quantum computing is a field that needs developers like you, not only for Quantum Computers but also for us to connect adjacent systems, create collaborative environments, push boundaries of what's possible, and be driven to explore the unknown. Many people like you are already on GitHub, creating, committing, forking and maintaining great innovations. You can find some of the best projects via our dedicated.
