Quantum computers are often perceived as scientific curiosities or a long way off. However, they are now within the grasp of developers. This module will demystify the principles of quantum computing and illustrate how you, as a developer, can contribute to this ground-breaking field. By understanding the foundational concepts, you will be prepared to take an active role in building the necessary tools for quantum computers and the rest of this course.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll:

- Explain the basic principles of quantum computing, including qubits, superposition, entanglement, interference and measurement.
- Understand the historical context and current state of quantum computing technology.
- Recognize the potential applications and implications of quantum computing.
- Identify resources and next steps for further learning and development in quantum computing.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of classical computing.
  - How computers store and process data.
  - Common programming languages such as Python and C/C++
- Familiarity with software development processes and tools.
- Some familiarity with fundamental physics concepts would be helpful.
