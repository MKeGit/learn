We often take computers for granted, but they're the result of decades of cutting-edge research. Companies and scientists are constantly advancing their understanding to build smaller, more powerful computers, and we, as users, accept them as an integral part of modern life. Whether it's your phone, smartwatch, work laptop, or a massive data center, these devices are a testament to the power of technology.

You don’t need to be an expert in fabricating transistors or designing Printed Circuit Boards to create world-changing applications. Similarly, you don’t need a PhD in Physics to contribute to the development of quantum computers. The intersection of disciplines sparks invention and discovery, and your unique perspective as a developer is valuable and integral to this journey.

One would be forgiven for thinking Quantum Computers are new. However, their roots date back to the early 80s. Starting as purely theoretical, these machines became real by the late 90's, and the first quantum algorithm was run in 2001.

In the 2010s, quantum computing moved from the academic lab to industry. Tech giants like Microsoft, IBM, Google, and innovative startups have invested heavily in developing quantum technology. They made significant strides in improving qubit coherence and reducing error rates, bringing us closer to practical quantum computers.  

Today, we stand on the brink of a quantum revolution. Quantum computing promises to transform fields as diverse as cryptography, optimization, material science, and beyond. While full-scale quantum computers are still on the horizon, the rapid advancements in this field are undeniable. Researchers and engineers are hard at work overcoming challenges in qubit stability, error correction, and system scalability.

Today is an exhilarating time. Quantum computing is poised to redefine what's possible in technology, much like classical computing did in the 20th century.  

This section covers some basics of quantum computing and guides your journey to the Quantum Stack.
