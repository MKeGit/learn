Congratulations on completing the module! 

We took a large step into the exciting world of quantum computing, gaining an understanding of its foundational principles—qubits, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement. You learned about the current state of quantum technology and why now is the perfect time to get involved. With this knowledge, you’re well on your way to contributing to the development of quantum computers and building groundbreaking algorithms that will shape the future of technology.

## Learning more about quantum information and computation

The field of quantum computing is highly complex and contains theoretical physics, complex mathematics, and advanced engineering. As a result, we avoid going into too much detail within this course.  

There are many resources that give more detail on each of these subjects and provide opportunities to learn more after completing this module.
