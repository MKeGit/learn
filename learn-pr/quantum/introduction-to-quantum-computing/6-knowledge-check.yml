  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: What is superposition in the context of quantum computing?
    choices:
    - content: "Superposition allows a qubit to exist only in the state 0"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "Superposition allows a qubit to exist only in the state 1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect"
    - content: "Superposition allows a qubit to exist in a combination of 0 and 1"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct."
    - content: "Superposition forces a qubit to switch states constantly between 0 and 1"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
  - content: In quantum computing, what is meant by measurement?
    choices:
    - content: "We measure the exact quantum state of the qubit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "We collapse the quantum state and measure the classical result"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct"
    - content: "We continuously measure the qubit to make sure itâ€™s in the correct state"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
    - content: "We measure the quantum state but leave the qubit unaffected"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect."
