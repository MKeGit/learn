Cloud services play a vital role in democratizing quantum computing. They enable access to some of the most powerful quantum computers over the cloud to companies and researchers worldwide.  

For example, Microsoft’s Azure Quantum platform and Amazon Bracket, enable users to access a wide range of today’s quantum hardware from leading companies. IBM’s Qiskit platform gives users access to IBM’s range of leading superconducting quantum computers.

Access through these services enables researchers to explore using quantum computers without the huge overhead of buying or building these machines. What’s more, today, we’re still exploring different modalities of quantum computers, each with a different underlying technology. Cloud access enables researchers to access the best of all quantum modalities and explore their differences.  

Various software development kits (SDKs) have been developed to abstract and use quantum hardware. Microsoft’s Q# or IBM’s Qiskit enable users to program quantum algorithms with minimal concern for the underlying hardware architecture.  

Users use these tools to create quantum jobs and submit them through a cloud platform to be run on their chosen hardware, for example, Rigetti’s superconducting quantum computers. These jobs are queued and run on real quantum hardware, and the user receives the result.

Today, hundreds of thousands of registered users access quantum computing hardware through various cloud providers. As the quantum computing power increases, the number of registered users will only grow.
