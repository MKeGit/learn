The middleware layer plays a crucial role in the quantum stack by bridging the gap between high-level applications and the underlying quantum hardware. This module explores the essential components of this layer, including compilers, calibration, UI & data management, and cloud integration. By understanding these components, you gain insights into the software development tasks that support and optimize quantum computing operations. 

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you'll:

- Explain the function and importance of compilers in the context of quantum computing.
- Understand the role the software has to play in the middle of the quantum stack.
- Recognize the importance of cloud integration in providing access to quantum computing resources globally.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of classical computing.
  - How computers store and process data.
  - Common programming languages such as Python and C/C++
- Familiarity with software development processes and tools.
- Some familiarity with fundamental physics concepts would be helpful.
